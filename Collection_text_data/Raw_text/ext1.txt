Preface 
 
While traditional business models of firms describe the logic of creating, delivering, and 
capturing value, new business models try to widen the perspective and respect new 
circumstances. The aim of sustainability stays in the centre so that new business models 
describe an organisation’s logic of value creating, delivering, and capturing by considering 
varying preferences and by focussing on multiple value creation not only in economic, but 
also in ecological and social terms. The examination of this new form of business models 
requires knowledge from a broad variety of domains as well as interdisciplinary and systemic 
thinking. 
In this context the University of Graz, Austria, and especially the Faculty of 
Environmental, Regional and Educational Sciences, which has a strong focus on 
interdisciplinary approaches, on sustainability and on social responsibility, is proud to host 
the 2nd International Conference on New Business Models. The first conference, which took 
place in Toulouse, France, in 2016, formed the solid basis and starting point for what seems 
to become a well-positioned conference being attractive for researchers and practitioners 
from many places in the world. Such events do not only foster the scientific exchange 
contributing to excellent research results, but also form the basis for a solution-oriented 
collaboration of science and society. 
I’m convinced that the scientific presentations, workshops and key note speeches during 
these two days will lead to fruitful discussions, inspire further research and initiate 
collaborations. Additionally, I hope you will enjoy the wonderful city of Graz and find time 
for a walk through its renowned historical centre. 
I wish you a successful and productive conference!

Word of welcome 
 
Dear participants,  
Welcome to the 2nd International Conference on New Business Models (NBM@Graz2017) 
entitled “Exploring a changing view on organizing value creation: Developing New Business 
Models”. 
After the first conference taking place in Toulouse, France, in 2016, we are very proud 
and happy to host and organize this second edition of our newly founded international 
conference format. We welcome about 115 participants from 20 different countries, ranging 
from Brazil to Turkey, and from Finland to Australia. It makes us very happy that this 
conference brings researchers and practitioners from various cultural and professional 
backgrounds together, hence leading to an exchange of views and knowledge, which in turn 
hopefully creates positive impact by fostering the distribution of new business models in 
various contexts. While organizing this series of conferences we can put further emphasis on 
the importance of new business models by building up a community of researchers and 
practitioners that share similar visions and are ready to pool the forces together pushing the 
change forwards. Beside discussing research work at the conference itself, we hope that 
many contributions make their way to one of the three Special Issues aligned with the this 
years’ conference, namely (1) the Special Issue in the International Journal of Corporate 
Social Responsibility (IJCSR), (2) the Special Issue in the Journal of Business Models (JoBM) 
and, (3) the Special Issue in the Journal of Accountancy & Bedrijfskunde.  
Organizing such an international event requires joint efforts and support from various 
partners. It would have been impossible without the encouraging and constant support of all 
the members of our sientific board, the members of our scientific committee, our session 
chairs 
and 
workshop 
organizers, 
and 
our 
reviewers! 
Thank 
you!  
Furthermore, we would like to say thank you to all our sponsors and promoters, and last but 
not least, thank you very much to all of you participating in this conference! This is what 
brings such a conference to life. We do hope that you enjoy your days in Graz!  
We also hope that you enjoy reading this report which includes abstracts or short 
papers of authors who are participating in the conference and presenting their work there. 
The proceedings are divided into three parts: Part 1 includes all abstracts, Part 2 includes all 
short papers and Part 3 comprises the workshop descriptions. Within Part 1 and Part 2 the 
abstracts and papers are arranged in the same way as they are presented at the conference 
ranging from Session 1 to Session 8.

After this conference we will hand over to Nikolay Dentchev and his team, who will 
organize the 3rd International Conference on New Business Models in Sofia, Bulgaria, next 
year (NBM@Sofia2018). We are already looking forward meeting you there too! 
Yours,

Prologue 
Seeing ourselves as an emerging field of research and practice1 
Some industries and even whole nations are in transition, gradually replacing the boundless 
pursuit of material prosperity by one driven by sustainable development, social inclusivity, 
and material circularity. However, we also witness the decline of ecological and social 
systems in many parts of the world (e.g., accelerating loss of biodiversity, food crises in 
many countries around the globe). Reverting this decline and supporting sustainability 
transitions requires various shifts in the economic realm as well as the broader societal and 
political domains. For example, the circular economy emphasises the thrifty use of materials 
and the transformation of open-ended supply chains to closed cycles of production and 
consumption. The bio-based economy aims to replace non-organic with organic materials. 
The functional and performance economies challenge the traditional transaction model of 
make-and-buy and replace this with product-as-service solutions. Other economic 
transitions focus on higher utilization of resources through (true) sharing, collaboration, and 
other forms of collective value creation.  
It is within all these economic transitions that we observe the emergence of a 
generation of new business models that foster sustainability, social inclusion, and circularity. 
We call these three strands of business models the “new business models.” Together they 
address various aspects of business modelling and in doing so they give substance to the 
economic transitions society desires since they are embedded in everyday transactions, be it 
between citizens or businesses. The New Business Models conference series started at 
Toulouse Business School, France, in 2016, and is currently celebrating its second 
anniversary. It aims to bring together scholars, practitioners, and others to share 
experiences, exchange insights etc., to collectively reach a deeper understanding and 
improve the repertoire of contention available to implement the necessary changes for 
sustainable economic transitions. 
Against this backdrop, we would like to use this year’s proceedings prologue to point to 
some remarkable developments that we, and surely many of our colleagues around the 
world, are currently observing. In particular, we like to point at the many research and 
practice activities, niche communities, publications, communication and publishing channels, 
and so forth, which emerge around those new business models. We see many valuable bits 
and pieces – or nodes and relationships – that emerge here and there and contribute to 
what is becoming a global network and community of scholars, business practitioners, policy 
makers, and civil society actors who follow a common vision: to enable all kinds of 
organisations, be it profit-driven or purely social mission-driven, to use the growing 
knowledge that results from business model research for the sake of stakeholder- and 
society-sensitive as well as circular and sustainable value creation. 

NBM@Graz2017

What does it take to create such a community, or, on a larger scale, a new field of 
research and practice? Following John Ehrenfeld, who famously described the emergence of 
the industrial ecology field in a classic article,2 it is at least four things that characterise a 
new field of research and practice: the shared major beliefs and concepts underpinning the 
field’s activities; the tools and resources developed and used within the field; authorities and 
points of reference; and a growing community of actors. 
We see that gradually common beliefs and concepts emerge in discussions and 
publications on this family of new business models. These beliefs and concepts are often 
formulated as normatively grounded propositions about what business models are, or more 
precise, should be or do (e.g., support stakeholder inclusion and multiple value creation, 
enable a systems perspective). They can be explored and debated from various perspectives, 
such as deontological, ethical, normative, functional, strategic, and so forth. Naturally this 
can be done from either a theoretical or an empirical viewpoint. Overall this shows a 
dynamic and iterative field moving back and forth between theory, concepts, empirical 
studies and discoveries embedded in an ongoing cycle of scientific refinement. An important 
and widely discussed topic is innovation tools and resources (e.g., tools like the “Clover Leaf 
Canvas Model” by Jan Jonker, or the book “Business Models for Sustainability” by Peter 
Wells). We do note that “standards” for sustainable, socially inclusive, or circular business 
modelling do not exist yet, but see a variety of approaches emerge – which is for sure not a 
bad thing. 
Regarding the community of actors, we find that a growing number of academics, 
practitioners, and policy makers deal with issues related to new business models. This gives 
rise to the development of a transdisciplinary field as they begin to exchange their 
knowledge across research-practice, disciplinary, and institutional boundaries (e.g., through 
reports published by global consulting firms, international publishers, or dissemination via 
social media). This emerging community is dealing with issues that are partly defined and 
spread by emerging authorities and points of reference in the field, namely a handful of 
academic journals (e.g., Journal of Cleaner Production, Organization & Environment) and 
institutions such as the OECD, the International Finance Corporation, or think-tanks like 
SustainAbility. Recently, this community has also found new platforms, besides online 
channels (e.g., Strongly Sustainable Business Model Group; SustainableBusinessModel.org), 
to meet on a regular basis, hence the annual New Business Models conference. 
A new field must be gradually institutionalised to last and evolve, and to be more than a 
passing fancy. We find some indicators of early institutionalisation processes mainly in 
academia, given for example the growing number of special issues of academic journals 
around business modelling. We also observe that the number of courses, be it on Bachelor 
or Master level, is growing. There is now also a MOOC on New Business Models 
(https://iversity.org/en/courses/new-business-models). We also see practical forms of 

NBM@Graz2017 
 
xiii 
institutionalisation, for example through increasing social impact investments and the rise of 
social enterprises. Shaped by growing knowledge on how to construct social business, the 
attractiveness to invest is growing. 
All in all, we see the emergence of a new field of research and practice. The 2nd 
International Conference on New Business Models, for which we serve as Board Members, is 
our contribution to developing and institutionalising this field. At the same time, this is an 
open call to you to actively participate, e.g. by joining the existing online and offline groups 
(e.g., Strongly Sustainable Business Model Group; SustainableBusinessModel.org), 
submitting papers to the upcoming special issues for this conference (e.g., International 
Journal of Corporate Social Responsibility), launching local events (e.g., business modelling 
workshops) … and much more. There is a lot we can do – together.

Business Models for the Circular Economy: 
Developing a typology based on existing

Introduction: what is at stake? 
 
Stimulating a transition towards a circular economy (CE) is becoming more and more the 
focus of attention for policymakers, business people, and scholars considering the growing 
upsurge of policy documents and research reports. The promise it entails to create an 
economy that operates within the boundaries of nature is hopeful, yet challenging given the 
fact that over the past one and a half century all efforts have been invested in developing a 
linear economy. No wonder, quite a gap can be observed between the political and societal 
promise of a CE and the economic and organizational reality of putting the idea of circularity 
into practice. Key is to design and organise an economy based on closed loops around 
materials. In essence this is done with the ambition to create in a balance way multiple 
values. This implies that different values such as ecological, social or material ‘capitals are 
addressed simultaneously by organisations. To shape this complex and sometimes even 
contradictory process of value creation and guide the outcomes a specific logic is needed. 
Different logics can be created given available assets and circumstances and the strategic 
choices made given this context. The leads to a variety of business models. This contribution 
sets out to understand the logic behind these business models by identifying the principal 
building blocks. 
 
Transition to a circular economy 
In order to realize the promise of the CE, businesses must massively transform from a linear 
to a circular way of operating. This implies designing and operationalizing closed loops 
around materials by a configuration of dedicated constituents that together are capable to 
closing a particular loop. The ambition of creating these closed loops is that products 
materials and spare-parts are used as long as possible. The lifetime of products, spare-parts, 
and the materials they are made of is extended by smart design and refurbishing leading to 
repetitive yet not unlimited reuse. Ultimately this has far reaching consequences for the 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
4 
design of products and their life-cycle. Instead of a take-make-waste philosophy the are 
designed on a take-make-use-refurbish-use-remanufacture etc. philosophy. This implies a 
transformation from a linear value-chain to a so-called value-cycle that is being created and 
maintained by multiple constituents. In turn this has far reaching consequences for business 
propositions, the organizational models between constituents, last but certainly not least 
the nature of revenue models. While in itself the idea of a CE has been around for at least 
half a century we now witness processes in different sectors of society whereby the idea of 
organising those closed loops are being put to practice. As a result, across various sectors 
and countries, a number of self-declared successful business cases can be observed, 
demonstrating to have one or another type of circular business model. Yet why they are 
successful, what kind of values are being created and what the underpinning logic is, 
remains difficult to observe left alone to compare.  
 
Circular design 
 
Linear business models are fuelled by the ambition to create as much value added as is 
feasible. The highest turnover component of this objective is to transform materials as 
efficiently as possible into products within a value chain. They are organization-centric, 
bottom-line leading to value creation measured in terms of costs and benefits. Leading 
design principle is planned obsolescence, supported by perceived obsolescence. This implies 
to design products in such a way that they will only function a limited period of time and are 
difficult thus costly to repair. The principle of closed loops is all but taken as a compass for 
the design and use of these products. This leads to a value creating logic where the role of 
materials or built in sustainability in terms of efficient left alone cyclical use of commodities 
does not matter. No wonder the underpinning logic that can be observed in the used 
business models offers no fundamental room for these issues. 
 
Business Model Ontology 
Many of today’s regular business models are implicitly or explicitly based upon the Business 
Model Canvas ontology. This is a strategic management template to either built for scratch 
or rebuilt a business model. It provides a systematic overview of key-activities and key-
resources including (partner) networks leading to defining a value proposition. The promise 
of this ontology is that it can be applied ion almost any situation. Yet the core, despite an 
embedded stakeholder perspective, is still very ‘linear’ and organisation-centric. It is driven 
by neo-classical assumptions in which creating financial shareholder value is the fulcrum of 
organizational activities. Paramount are, bottom-line, two decisive building blocks: cost and 
revenues. Designing a value creating logic that favours the latter is the bare essence of these 
kind of business models. As a consequence, the notion of value creation is narrowed down 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
5 
to an almost purely financial focus. Although during the process of organising the creation of 
other values are not prohibited yet they are subordinated to the cost-benefit balance.  A 
closer look at the BMC shows that principles such as eco-design or eco-efficiency, need to fit 
to this balance. Conversions and alterations of the BMC, such as the Triple Layered Business 
Model Canvas, Honey Comb Business Model or the Borrow-Use-Return Model do not 
overcome this issue since in the end they still hold the traditional cost-benefit analysis as the 
dominating principle to define either success or failure.   
 
Circular business models 
Circular business models (CBM) are based on the premise of either fully or partially closing 
material loops. Core of these business models is a process with multiple transactions over 
time leading to value-cycles whereby CBMs promise to contribute to sustainability which can 
be expressed in social, ecological, material and financial values. This is called multiple value 
creation (MVC). It remains difficult to assess what MVC exactly entails left alone how the 
balancing of values in the process of multiple-value creation is established. Yet its emerging 
application can be ascertained in rather innovative approaches such as Integrated Reporting 
(IR). Integrated Reporting is the way to achieve a more coherent corporate reporting system, 
that provides a fuller picture of organizations’ ability to create value in various domains. 
These domains are called ‘capitals’ of which six are depicted: financial, manufactured, 
intellectual, human, social and natural. Evidently it echo’s the Triple P approach proposed by 
Elkington in the ‘90s but now adds an operational dimension enabling to frame multiple 
values. This is a great step forward in the debate on creating multiple values in and between 
organisations. 
 
Making a trace in the sand 
Despite the increasing literature on CBMs it continues to be ambiguous concerning 
stipulating a clear starting point of the (inter) organizational challenges a circular economy 
entails. Organising a closed loop is quite a challenge given the fact that parties have not 
been working in such a way for the last say one hundred and fifty years. Inter-organisational 
revenue models hardly exist. No wonder existing classifications of CBMs lack a general and 
coherent framework identifying principles, value-creating logics, strategies, and building 
blocks leading to a piling up of different business models which all share some 
characteristics which resembles CBMs. The empirical underpinning of these classifications 
hardly goes beyond the anecdotal use of cases. Empirical evidence comes from a broad 
variety of sources and related contexts. No wonder a clear and transparent way of clarifying 
the logic of multiple value creation linked to CBM is lacking.

Building a typology 
Against this backdrop and despite the empirical and methodological criticism we set out in 
this contribution to develop a typology of CBMs. This typology is based on five assumptions. 
First, CBMs must - at least to some extent - aim at closing resource loops. Second, they must 
also deliver ecological and social value in addition to financial value. Third, it is assumed that 
this creates opportunity for a set of dedicated business strategies. These first three 
assumptions will foster new (inter) organizational collaborative models which subsequently 
urge developing revenue models between constituents based on ongoing value creation in 
value cycles. We use these assumptions as the five building blocks of CBMs which enable 
classifying existing examples leading to a typology. Between early 2016 and Spring 2017 
research was carried out to explore this typology based on the five building blocks. This 
research shows that some of the published typologies are still rather conceptual and, 
therefore, not discriminating enough to be of practical use in designing conceptual and 
empirical research on CBMs. This while in its infancy it also demonstrated that these building 
blocks offer a solid ground to develop a typology. While the work that needs to be 
undertaken is still in progress we express a solid if not firm belief that the research 
undertaken offers maple ground for a solid typology for BMCE’s.

The Evolution of waste exchange platforms’ 
business models

In 2012, Europe experienced an astonishing loss of 95 percent of the material and energy 
value (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015). Over the last years different initiatives have been 
adopted to reduce the amount of waste produced by businesses. Although ‘zero-waste’ 
goals are increasingly embraced by companies, considerable amounts of waste and surplus 
materials still result from production processes, causing both economic and environmental 
value destruction. In this context, “the exchange and reprocessing of wastes and other 
excess resources from one firm into valuable inputs for another” (Paquin et al., 2015: 95), 
has been viewed as a powerful approach to minimize waste. Concurrently with the diffusion 
of online platforms allowing peer-to-peer exchange of products and services, over the last 
years different actors have engaged in creating, managing and supporting business-to-
business platforms, which match firms selling their wastes and ‘surplus materials’ with those 
willing to buy them (Dhanorkar et al., 2015). The matchmaking can involve basic or more 
sophisticated activities by the platform operator.  
Yet, these so-called ‘circulation platforms’ (Kortmann and Piller, 2016) or ‘online 
materials and waste exchange platforms’ (Dhanorkar et al., 2015) have received scant 
attention from management scholars. Given the increasing number of circulation platforms 
across different countries and sectors, and since “the choice of a business model seems to 
be the key to the success of a platform” (Rochet and Tirole, 2003: 991), our study adopts the 
platform operators’ perspective and explores how they develop and foster the growth of 
their business model.   
The study adopts a multiple case study research design (Yin, 2003). The cases consist of 
6 established circulation platforms; for each case we have explored, through primary and 
secondary data, the evolution of their business models since the creation of the platform.

Abstract 
Business models are increasingly being addressed by non-business oriented organizations 
because of the added-value they bring in understanding how a system can be more 
sustainable. In the context of energy for instance, the shift from centralized to de-centralized 
systems to allow the transition towards more sustainable energy supply and use, require the 
collaboration of several stakeholders, among which businesses producing and delivering 
energy, but also energy users (public services, households, industry), public utilities, and 
policy-makers at a local, regional, national and international level. Consequently, for some 
products and services, there is a need to consider the system they are embedded in in a 
holistic manner. However, a challenge remains in identifying the stakeholders to engage 
with to build a sustainable business model. Stakeholder identification is a step that is often 
neglected and conducted with bias, although it is the basis to understand which 
stakeholders are part of the system under consideration and investigate their roles. We 
address this issue here by taking a supply chain perspective combined with concepts from 
the stakeholder management field of research and present a structured process to identify 
stakeholders. This process has been developed by identifying stakeholders in the field of 
mercury trade over the period 2014-2016, and further tested in the field of sustainable 
energy supply in 2015.  Our aim is here to present how this process can be used to support 
the development of sustainable business models with different tools as examples (e.g., the 
Business Model Canvas) and to define who the beneficiaries of such a combination may be 
(e.g. Public Private Partnerships). We show that by identifying thoroughly stakeholders with 
the suggested process, it is possible to obtain a comprehensive picture of present and future 
stakeholders in a system and to avoid especially the risk of omission or bias that put at risk 
the successful implementation of business models. Also, by engaging already with various 
stakeholder groups during the stakeholder identification step, the process enables to 
connect stakeholders together and increase the opportunities for dialog and the

identification of synergies. By providing a more comprehensive picture of the stakeholders in 
place, it is also possible for organisations to develop a value proposition for stakeholder 
groups that would otherwise be ignored with traditional client-centred business model 
development methods.

Abstract  
Symbiotic relations in industrial clusters provide the perfect breeding ground for innovative 
ideas to achieve resource and energy efficiency, and ultimately aim for a circular economy. 
This paper focuses on the role of an industrial symbiosis facilitator (ISF) that drives industrial 
symbiosis (IS) within and between self-organised industrial clusters and the community, 
towards resource efficiency (RE) at the regional level. Simple one-to-one contractual 
partnerships lack the complexity to tackle the multitude of factors that orient industrial 
networks; hence a legal organisation of the partnership is needed to structure decision-
making processes, to simplify operations and to guarantee continuity of the symbiotic 
activities. 
Large and established (multi-national) companies face significant barriers in business 
model redesign due to the institutionalisation of existing mental models and physical 
infrastructures (Bocken, Rana, & Short, 2015; Jonker & O’Riordan, 2016). Often, their focus is 
incremental improvement (Christensen, 2013; Massa & Tucci, 2013), translating to increased 
resource and energy efficiency while maintaining business as usual. Using the Value 
Mapping Tool (Bocken et al., 2015), the core of an ISF is placed in the outer rings of the 
business model of established businesses. It captures the value missed in the form of 
underused resources, from multiple businesses, and turns them into opportunities via IS, 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
12 
which the personnel of the company might miss because of their focus on their core 
business (Van Beers, Bossilkov, Corder, & van Berkel, 2007). 
It is not possible to create shared value without connectivity and reciprocity, thus 
without linkages and collaborations nothing can be traded, shared, or created (Jonker & 
O’Riordan, 2016) and an ISF provides this opportunity. The ISF is proposed to fulfil the role of 
glue between the different actors; the industry, local businesses, community and the local 
authorities (Maqbool, Piccolo, Zwaenepoel, & Eetvelde, 2017) while capturing value for itself 
by providing its services to the multiply stakeholders. The ISF responds to the societal need 
of RE from the process and manufacturing industries, by thinking globally and acting locally. 
The key partners of ISF in this pursuit are the waste managers, local authorities, recycling 
industries, logistics providers and local and regional industrial associations. The core services 
of the ISF include helping resource and energy intensive industry for finding local needs to 
consume their underused resources.  
Highly skilled human resource is the key to ISF’s success. The value proposition of ISF lies 
in links with multiple stakeholders, knowledge of legal certification and different funding 
schemes to support RE. The customer relationships are maintained by continuous 
interaction between the ISF and the IS partners. The channels to reach the customer 
segments include platforms like sector associations, web-sites, city council, online platform 
for matchmaking and frequently organised networking sessions. The cost structure is based 
on the variable costs for the services provided. Revenue streams would include operation 
service fee from IS partners, management of the platform for match-making, service costs 
for subsidy applications filed, brokerage fee for putting IS partners together.   
Ultimately a private ISF answers to the bottom-up initiatives that are more sustainable 
and more inclusive where large multi-national companies may find themselves obstructed.

Abstract 
The relationship between circular business models (CBMs) and sustainable business models 
(SBMs) remains contested (Lewandowski, 2016). The SBM literature acknowledges the need 
for synergies between environmental and social value creation but recognises that in 
practice, firms often focus one form of value creation over the other - rather than both 
(Bocken et al. 2014). More recently, the role of circular economy (CE) as a new paradigm for 
sustainability has been explored (Geissdorfer et al. 2017).  
CE emphasises creating environmental and economic value from turning waste into a 
productive resource, and beyond recognition of potential job creation from a shift in the 
economy to more circular production systems (Stahel, 1984), social ideals and their 
relationship to value creation tend not to be explicitly addressed. Murray et al. (2015) 
argued that in order for CE to be coherent with sustainable development, it needs to include 
explicit consideration of social impacts and social value creation. This echoes earlier 
arguments that equating sustainability to CE, without such considerations, runs the risk of 
reducing sustainability to material efficiency at the expense of broader ideals of equity, 
morality and social justice (Ehrenfeld, 2000) given one of its core foundations is the 
biological/ecosystem metaphor (Brennan et al. 2015). 
More recent alternative interpretations of CE, particularly in the grey literature, have 
espoused that poverty is a social waste – which results in the waste of valuable human 
resources (Lemille, 2016). This implies that implementing CBMs in developing country 
contexts has the potential to create employment related to transforming waste resources 
where unemployment is high and labour relatively cheaper. None-the-less beyond existing 
considerations of the job creation potential of CE, broader social considerations have not yet 
been adequately incorporated into the emerging discourse.  

 
NBM@Graz2017

This in part is due to the perceived novelty of the idea which has not been closely 
examined (Gregson et al. 2015). It is also due to the sheer complexity of the technical 
challenges raised when considering the details associated with attempting to re-configure 
and re-design materials, products, and tack-back systems. Thus, while it is recognised that 
social impact and social value creation are important considerations in the context of CE, the 
question remains how CBMs can simultaneously generate economic, environmental and 
multiple forms of social value in practice?  
Sustainable prosperity is underpinned by the principle that value creation and increased 
quality of life can both be decoupled from resource use (Jackson, 1996; Jackson, 2009; 
Moore, 2005; Jackson, 2017). Related to this concept are explorations of how to create 
conditions for the emergence of economies where people can flourish (Ehrenfeld, 2004; 
Ehrenfeld & Hoffman, 2013) and the need to incorporate safe social-operating boundaries 
(Raworth, 2012) in addition to recognition of physical planetary boundaries (Rockstrom et al. 
2009). 
Using sustainable prosperity as a lens, this conceptual paper will, based on a literature 
review, explore how to operationalise these and associated ideas within the evolving CE and 
CBM debates. This paper seeks to develop insights which unpack the relationship between 
sustainable business models in general and circular business models in order to address the 
following question: 
 How can ideas associated with sustainable prosperity and flourishing be 
operationalised in CBMs so that they successfully contribute to the generation of 
economic, environmental and multiple forms of social value in practice?

Collaborative Value Creation in Innovation 
projects for a Circular City

Over the last decade, the concept of a circular economy, an industrial economy that is 
restorative or regenerative by intention and design, has gained increased attention of policy 
makers, industry and academics (Geissdoerfer, Sayaget, Bocken and Hultink, 2017). Recently 
the number of innovation projects that are set up to experiment with new sustainable 
technologies to advance the transition towards a circular city has increased substantially, the 
initiators being local governments, communities, NGOs and business (Prendeville, Cherim 
and Bocken, 2017). Although the literature on circular economy and circular cities stresses 
the importance of bottom-up initiatives, a gap seems on how different stakeholders in 
bottom-up initiatives collaboratively create value and develop sustainable business models 
for these innovations for a circular city. The aim of this research is to explore how in the 
emerging field of circular city innovation projects, bottom-up initiated by for example NGOs 
and businesses, different stakeholders are involved in the collaborative value creation 
process and how they collaboratively create value and develop a viable business model for 
the project, whilst maintaining value for each partner involved. We do so by building on 
literature on circular economy, sustainable and collaborative business modelling and value 
networks. 
Different scholars show that the CE literature can be divided in research on three levels: 
macro-level (cities, regions or nations), meso-level (eco-industrial parks) and micro-level 
(single firms or products) (e.g. Ghisellini, Cialani and Ulgiati, 2016; Su, Heshmati, Geng and 
Yu, 2013). At all levels, the literature stresses the importance of new business models and 
collaboration with a variety of stakeholders. New business models are widely recognized as 
conditions for implementing sustainability-oriented innovations (Boons and Lüdeke-Freund, 
2013; Schaltegger, Lüdeke-Freund and Hansen, 2012) and are considered important in the 
transition towards a CE (e.g. Geissdoerfer et al., 2017). For this purpose, many scholars have 
developed definitions and frameworks that extend the generic business model concept 
towards sustainable, social and circular business models (e.g. Yunus, Moingeon and 
Lehmann-Ortega, 2010) and circular business models. These business model definitions and 
frameworks have three perspectives in common related to the creation of value:  

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
18 
 a multiple value perspective, extending economic value provided by the value 
proposition with environmental and social value (e.g. Bocken, Short, Rana and Evans, 
2014; Yunus et al., 2010); 
 a multi-stakeholder perspective on value creation, considering a wide range of 
stakeholder interests (e.g. Lüdeke-Freund, Bocken, Brent, Massa, and Musango, 
2016);  
 a value network perspective, constituting the whole constellation of actors involved 
in the value creation process (e.g. Antikainen and Valkokari, 2016; Doganova & 
Eyquem-Renault, 2009; Chesbrough & Rosenbloom, 2002). 
Although the majority of the business model literature takes a single firm perspective, 
recently a number of scholars presented and discussed new tools and methods for 
collaborative business model innovation, e.g. Jonker (2016); Lindgren, Taran and Boer, 
(2009); Rohrbeck, Konnertz and Knab (2013). Common in these methods is that individual 
business models and value captures need to be in accord with the common business model. 
Breuer and Lüdeke-Freund (2017) add the notion of values, arguing that 'purposeful 
innovation requires considering the shared values of those engaging in innovation 
processes'. A gap seems to exist though in how the values of stakeholders shape their roles 
in the value creation process and how tangible and intangible value is created and shared 
with these models, whilst in the meantime capturing stakeholder-specific values.  
For this study we take a qualitative research approach, using a multiple case study 
design to improve the external validity (Yin, 2003). Four collaborative innovation projects, 
bottom-up initiatives that are set up to experiment with new sustainable technologies to 
advance the transition towards a city that recycles and upcycles waste, are selected using a 
theoretical replication logic (Yin, 2003). All four projects are examples of bottom-up 
initiatives with explicit goals to create shared value and are characterized by collaboration of 
a wide variety of stakeholders. Two of them can be considered an urban living lab, initiated 
and coordinated by an NGO and supported by external funding and support for example by 
municipalities. Two of them initiated and coordinated by business and are executed without 
any additional funding. The data consists of 10 in-depth retrospective interviews with key 
project partners and 56 additional data sources. The cases are analysed by an inductive 
research approach consisting of within-case analysis and cross case analyses using pattern 
matching techniques. 
The preliminary results show that participation in projects for a circular economy is 
mainly environmentally and socially driven with an aim to innovate, demonstrate 
sustainable solutions and inspire others to contribute to the transition towards a circular 
economy. The data reveals that, regardless the starting point and coordination, the 
partnerships remain open to new collaborations. Salient for the value network is that three 
roles vary throughout the project and change their contribution to the value creation

process, e.g. public organisations and private companies that originally take part as 
facilitator,  in a later stage may also become involved as knowledge provider and/or 
customer of the value that is created. The collective value that is developed, is largely non-
financial and encompasses clear ecological benefits (e.g. material reuse, reduction CO2 
emissions) and social benefits (e.g. education, creating awareness, community building) for a 
wide variety of stakeholders, ranging from the city as a whole to specific beneficiaries. The 
value capture shows how this collective value fits together with the individual value each 
partner captures from the project, that includes financial as well as intangible benefits.  
The paper contributes to the business modelling and circular economy literature by 
showing possible motivations for different stakeholder types to engage in innovation for a 
circular city and by indicating the multiple types of individual and collective business model 
value that may be pursued. The paper further shows how different stakeholder types 
conciliate creating common value with individual interests.

A Typology of customer value creation in 
circular business models 
Erwan Mouazan, Faculty of business studies, University of Vaasa

Keywords 
Circular Business model; Customer Value Creation 
Abstract 
Customer value creation is recognized as a critical part of a business strategy and perceived 
as the fundamental basis for all marketing activity. First defined as a unidimensional concept 
referring to the trade-off between benefits received and sacrifices made to acquire a 
product or service (Monroe, 1990), the very notion of customer value has since then been 
studied from a multiplicity of dimensions, and its complex and dynamic nature has been 
often. The paper explores the notion of customer value creation in the context of circular 
business model innovation (CBMI). CBMI may come as a novel solution to solve current 
pressing business challenges, such as the rise in commodity prices or the increase scarcity of 
specific resources. With increasing resource constraints on one hand, and a growing concern 
from customers for sustainability-related business practices, redefining value creation in the 
framework of circular business models becomes more than relevant for businesses. 
Companies seeking to implement a circular business model may need to reevaluate their 
customer value creation strategy accordingly, as conventional notions of ownership transfer, 
traditional pricing fees, or distinctive usage patterns are being challenged in circular business 
models. 
Literature around circular business model innovation, which aims at exploring the 
rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value from closed-loop & 
circular strategies is today at a nascent stage. It is often considered as a sub-stream of 
sustainable business model innovation. In this emerging stream, little has been studied 
regarding customer value creation. To bridge this gap, the article explores which dimensions 
of customer value creation are emphasized in circular business models. More specifically, 
the paper aims to clarify which combination of value dimensions can appeal to customers, 
based on an adapted typology of customer value creation. 
First, a literature review of customer value creation is helping framing the concept and 
helps clarifying the main dimensions of customer value creation. Second, an overview of 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
22 
circular business models recent literature outlines the main dimensions of CBM and helps 
drawing specific typologies of CBM. The bridging of the two notions - customer value 
creation and circular business models - helps developing a theoretical framework (circular 
customer value creation) that is then applied to 65 cases of circular business models drawn 
from existing literature and representing the diversity of circular business models (in 6 
different sectors,  as well as in B2B and B2C contexts). Preliminary results are challenged and 
discussed with a narrowed selection of companies’ representatives and key EU experts in 
circular economy, in order to validate the preliminary conclusions of the research. Five cases 
illustrate how the circular customer value creation compass can be used in practice.  
At theoretical level, the paper revisits different customer value creation frameworks and 
adapts it to circular business model innovation. The tool can support managers and 
entrepreneurs active in the circular economy to clarify their circular value proposition. At 
practical level, the various value constellations inherent to each category of circular business 
model are outlined, and results offer illustrated specificities for each CBM category.

Quick scan for the social impact of reuse 
scenarios in a circular economy

Abstract 
For the transition to a more circular economy, it is important to know how the cycling of 
resources will affect value creation of businesses (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013). Key 
business model strategies that are identified by Bocken et al. (2016) that fit the approach of 
slowing and closing resource cycles are ‘Extending product value’ and ‘Extending resource 
value’. In these strategies, the residual value of products or resources is exploited by turning 
otherwise wasted product (parts) or materials into new forms of value.  
Increasingly, social value is considered of importance next to economic and 
environmental value. To assess the value of a certain product, life cycle analyses are 
considered to most accurately approximate impacts over the life span of a product. 
Extensive literature exists on environmental life cycle analyses and business modelling for 
financial impact of products. The knowledge on social impact is less extensive and 
methodologies for social lifecycle assessments (SLCA’s) are still in an early stage of 
development (Jørgensen et al., 2008; Ekener Petersen, 2015). Nonetheless, in the past years, 
several guidelines have been developed to assess the social impact of products over their 
lifespan (UNEP, 2009; Fontes, 2016). Although an effort is done to make these guidelines as 
practical and implementable as possible, they are based on the availability of several key 
performance indicators that are not always easily accessible and require extensive data 
search. Moreover, in the early stages of product development, profound analysis is difficult 
because of undefined factors in design, materialisation, production processes and 
production locations. In this paper we present a quick scan approach to asses social impact 
of reusing product parts or materials at an early stage in the decision making process.  
Based on the available literature on guidelines for social life cycle assessment and on 
interviews with experts on social impact analyses we defined the social topics to take into 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
24 
consideration in the framework for a quick scan. With these social topics in mind, possible 
reuse scenarios were built. In a workshop with designers and business professionals, the 
possible impact of each of the scenarios on the social topics was discussed. 
We tested this approach in the case of a Dutch company that has a uniform waste 
stream of plastic stadium seats at its disposal. The base-line scenario was partial recycling 
and partial incineration of the plastic material. Several alternative reuse scenarios for 
product parts or materials could be imagined. Based on this test case we formulate our first 
findings and conclusions about the strengths and limitations of this ‘quick scanning’ method 
for social impact of a circular economy case. 
Initial results indicate that existing guidelines are not readily suited at a scenario stage 
of evaluation of the reuse of parts and materials. The proposed conceptual framework does 
help to generate insights in impact of the possible alternative scenarios. We found that in a 
circular business case it is even more difficult to determine the system boundaries for a 
social life cycle analysis than in a linear business case. We learned that, on one hand, certain 
social topics that are suggested in existing guidelines are not applicable in this particular 
reuse case because it was characterized by the fact that it aimed to source all production 
steps within the Amsterdam region. This meant that topics that we take for granted in 
Western countries, like abolishment of child labour and forced labour, and secured fair 
salary and health and safety at the work floor, are not helpful in distinguishing scenarios 
from each other. On the other hand, topics that could discriminate between circular 
production scenarios and traditional linear scenarios, like emotional value of reusing product 
(parts) and awareness of end-of life scenarios are not distinctively enough represented in 
the existing guidelines. This was specifically the case in the consumer stakeholder group of 
topics. 
We propose an extension of the categorisation with more topics related to emotional 
value, awareness of end-of life scenarios, and other topics that represent the circular 
economy, particularly in the consumer stakeholder group. This paper contributes to 
academia by adding an extension to the social impact categories mentioned in literature, 
which could contribute to optimize social impact assessment in circular economy business 
models that aim to extend product and resource value. It contributes to practice by 
improving the usability of the SLCA in a more circular economy.

Unfolding challenges of business model 
innovation towards circular economy: The 
case of fashion industry  
Kerli Kant Hvass, PhD

Keywords  
Circular economy, business models, closed loop, fashion industry, qualitative case study 
Abstract  
Over  the  last  decades  there  has  been  a  call  for  finding  solutions  and  implementing 
strategies  that  aim  for more efficient use of natural resources and sustainable 
development within our societies (Brundtland et al. 1987).  In addressing this, the  concept 
of circular economy has  recently gained extensive attention (EMF 2012; 2013), even though 
the concept is not a new and traces back several decades to Stahel  & Reday’s (1976) work 
on the ecology  behind product life extensions and their sketched  vision  for “an economy of 
loops” or “circular economy.“ 
Addressing  circular  economy is an emerging field in industry, academia and policy, 
however,  there is limited research that  studies  this  concept  from  a business  model 
perspective supported with empirical evidence. Traditional fashion companies’ business  
models  mainly  focus  on  creating  and  capturing  value from  the  sale  of  new  products, 
while aspects  related  to circular economy principles,  such  as  product take-back,  reuse  
and  recycling are often  not  an integral part. The aim of this article is to explore the 
organizational and supply chain related issues in relation to implementing a closed loop 
recycling-focused circular economy strategy in an existing business model. The paper is 
based on empirical findings from a 34 month long qualitative case study of a leading 
Scandinavian fashion brand and the study followed an engaged scholarship strategy (Van de 
Ven, 2007).  
The findings identify issues and challenges that impact the successful implementation of 
a product take-back system and closed loop recycling into an existing business model. The  
study  shows  that  closed  loop  fashion  is  a  complex  matter  with  several  uncertainties 
and difficulties that span across the  entire  value  chain. Moving towards a circular textile 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
27 
system implies wider systemic change and innovation, not only in business models, but also 
in technologies, production practices, policies and consumer behaviour.  
At a micro level, the findings conclude that in order to integrate circular economy 
practices into the existing business model, rethinking existing value propositions and 
modifying several or all business model elements is required. For example, the findings 
reveal a need for organizational learning and a common understanding of the circular 
economy value proposition among internal stakeholders. An additional finding is that 
circular business models require an extended understanding of customers where it is 
important to see them as suppliers and co-producers of post-consumer value of products 
and materials. Finally, integrating circular economy strategies into business models may 
bring along radical changes to how companies perceive its products and relationships with 
customers and other stakeholders.  
Overall, the research provides a unique contribution as it synthesizes the theoretical  
and empirical insights from the field of business model innovation and circular economy 
with a focus on product and material circularity and management of post-consumer waste 
streams in a specific industry context.

Modelling interconnected business 
models in the circular economy value 
chain: The story of portable batteries

Introduction 
Circular economy is a new economic model that 
relates to transition from linear to circular value 
chain (e.g. Lewandowski, 2015; Ghisellini et al., 
2016; Lieder and Rashid, 2016). Sustainability on 
circular 
economy 
can 
be 
achieved 
thought 
modifications on business models on entire 
industries’ system value chains (Kortmann and Piller 
2015). This means that circular economy is hardly 
possible without collaboration between all actors in 
the value chain from manufacturing to recycling 
(Roos 2014).  
In this study business model is seen as a formal conceptual modelling approach for circular 
economy (Baden-Fuller and Morgan 2010; Mangematin and Baden-Fuller 2015; Massa et al. 
2017). Recent literatures on sustainable business models (Boons and Ludeke-Freund, 2013) 
and industry system value chains (Porter and Kramer 2011) have addressed the issues of 
sustainability. We divide circular economy value chain into four phases: 1) design and 
manufacturing; 2) sales and retail; 3) repair and collection; and 4) recycle and reuse (Figure 
1). To model each value chain position, we have selected four business model elements: 1) 
offer; 2) upstream interface; 3) downstream interface and; 4) financial model (Figure 1). 
These business model elements enable structuration of interaction analysis between 
different value chain positions and implications of circular economy to each position’s offer 
and financial performance.   
Methods 
Electronics industry is one of the fastest growing sectors and inefficient integration of 
circular economy principles in the industry value chain causes serious environmental and

social hazards worldwide (UNEP, 2015). We have selected case study research method to 
study the implications of circular economy principles to business models of different actors 
in the portable batteries value chain. We have conducted semi-structured interviews with 
seven key private and public organizations in Finland that have a role in the portable 
batteries value chain. We develop conceptual model for parallel and sequenced business 
models to organize a narrative story (Margetta 2002) of portable batteries’ circulation in the 
global value chain. 
Findings and results 
This research has theoretical, managerial and policy implications. Theoretical outcome 
of this study is the conceptual model that enables simultaneous consideration of 
interconnected business models in the circular economy value chain. Managerial 
implications indicate that even product markets have become global, the circular economy 
remains local meaning that a link is missing between design and manufacturing and recycling 
and reuse. Policy implications indicate that circular economy is hardy possible without policy 
dialogue and intermediary interventions that support interaction and value capture for all 
actors in the value chain. We found that local intermediary organizations can only have 
limited interventions on value chains that are global by nature. 
Conclusions 
In this study we have developed and tested conceptual modelling framework to circular 
economy value chain. We argue that for circular economy to materialize requires 
considering implications of business models in different value chain positions and 
understanding how to improve the communication and collaboration between different 
actors in the value chain. Moreover we highlight the importance of system level governance 
of institutions, such as public authorities and public-private facilitating organizations.

Introduction 
Sustainable Development is seen as unlikely without sustainable development of 
organizations. Companies are challenged by various stakeholders to address sustainability 
issues arising from their value creation process. Corporate management and other decision-
makers within the company have important roles to play in changing the modus operandi of 
the whole company, and thus, also the business model of the company, to deal with these 
challenges.  
Business Models for Sustainability (BMfS) is a term used for business models that 
integrate sustainability aspects in the core of organizations. While there is an increasing 
number of scholars researching and classifying the types of BMfS and different value 
creation aspects, there is still the need to understand the transition or transformation 
processes of companies, and particularly the role of decision-makers, that can hinder or 
encourage the change towards sustainability. 
Theoretical Background 
Decision-making support systems as well as sustainability management tools support key 
managers and other decision-makers to make decisions using reasonable amount of 
information and time. Previous research shows some links between the sustainability 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
33 
awareness of key employees and the application of sustainability management tools in 
decision-making (Hörisch et al. 2015), which can subsequently lead to Business Models for 
Sustainability. Insights about corporate sustainability management, such as addressed 
topics, causes of concerns about sustainability issues and real life praxis in companies can 
help to understand, how to enable more sustainable organizational development with a help 
of certain company structures as decision-making systems – wisely managed and delegated 
responsibly for sustainability topics in the company.  
Methodology 
A survey by Schaltegger et al. has described the status quo of corporate sustainability 
management in Germany (Schaltegger et al. 2012), as well as in cooperation with group of 
international researchers, they have compared the sustainability management in 11 
countries (Schaltegger et al. 2013). These studies provide context for benchmarking results 
of further studies, as well as can serve as basis for framework to analyze status quo of 
corporate sustainability management in Austria. Additionally, questions identifying change 
processes in company -  in the core product group, service, or operating industry,- should 
enable analysis of relation between decision-making for sustainability, particular corporate 
sustainability management practices and business model transformation for sustainability. 
This first-time corporate sustainability survey in Austria will address large companies. In 
2015, there were 1069 enterprises in Austria that had 250 or more employees, and over 50 
million Euro turnover; and these companies were contributing 39.4% of the total value 
added by the enterprises in Austria (EU 2015). The survey will consist of questions 
addressing range of sustainability activities, such as interaction with stakeholders, 
knowledge and use of sustainability management tools, as well as the questions that aim at 
identification of change processes in the company. The survey will address 
Sustainability/CSR managers or persons that have main responsibility for the sustainability 
topics in the company, and will be done with a help of online platform.  
Results 
This study is a contribution to attempts to describe status quo of corporate sustainability 
management in large companies in Austria; and it is a starting point for identification of 
companies that undergo business model change for sustainability, to further explore, 
understand and enable such processes. Additional emphasis is put on exploring the role of 
decision-makers, to see if there are considerable differences in operationalization and 
outcomes of sustainability management, leading to changes in business model, depending 
on the existence or non-existence of the sustainability/CSR manager.

Contribution 
In the best-case scenario, the survey will also help to understand if companies purposefully 
aimed to reach some sustainability level and adjusted their business model to serve this 
interest, or the companies merely try to survive in the business environment and improved 
sustainability performance is outcome of such efforts.  
The next steps of research after the survey will include in-depth case studies on 
companies that have undergone transformation for sustainability to identify the critical 
points of transformation and have further insights on decision-making support systems.

Abstract 
The forest-based sector (FBS) is in a period of facing many profound structural changes, such 
as changing consumer demands and values, globalization, the strengthening role of 
emerging economies, digitalization, climate change, increasing sustainability goals and 
transition towards the bio- and circular economies (Hansen et al., 2013; Hetemäki & 
Hurmekoski, 2014; Pätäri et al., 2016).  
The success of companies in the long term requires that they upgrade their business 
models and resources in line with strategic goals and changing business environment. For 
these reasons the FBS companies are developing new products based on forest biomass, 
such as bioenergy, raw material for textile industries, nanopulp and microfibrillated cellulose 
which can be utilized in a variety of sectors (Hetemäki, 2014). It is obvious that in addition to 
large-scale biorefineries there are various other opportunities in de-centralized, higher 
value-added, small-scale production and service-based businesses, which means 
fundamental change for the sector (Ollikainen, 2014; Näyhä et al., 2015; Schipfer et al., 
2017).  There is also increased need for cross-sectorial collaboration because development 
of new product portfolios requires expertise from different fields (Näyhä & Pesonen, 2014; 
Toppinen et al., 2017).   
Environmental, social and economic sustainability are important drivers for the 
transition towards new forest-based business models. Further, in many contexts, the rise of 
bioeconomy and circular economy businesses are associated with increased sustainability

(Pulzl et al., 2014; Pfau et al., 2014; Ghisellini et al., 2016). Wood-based businesses are often 
considered environmentally sustainable given wood’s status as a renewable natural 
resource. However, forest management can have adverse impacts on the ecosystems.  In 
particular, large-scale harvesting for bioenergy production and the related impacts on soil 
carbon stocks and biodiversity has aroused criticism of its environmental and social 
acceptance among many stakeholders (Näyhä & Horn, 2012; Pfau et al., 2014; Seppälä et al., 
2015).  
While actively seeking new opportunities and creating business models, both actors in 
the FBS and their stakeholders increasingly highlight a need for commonly accepted, 
sustainable future directions for the sector (Hetemäki, 2014; Hagemann, 2016). This study 
aims to explore existing and emerging new business models and ways of value creation in 
transforming FBS companies. Further, the study focuses on the sustainability considerations; 
e.g. how sustainability principles are integrated in the business models, which sustainability 
dimensions and challenges are highlighted, and how actors perceive their business models in 
relation to bioeconomy and circular economy goals which are linked with the sustainability 
principles. Moreover, the study aims to clarify what kind of resources, capabilities, and 
collaboration are needed for successful implementation of new business models. This 
information is important not only for the sector itself when developing their strategies but 
also for the various other societal actors. 
In this study 18 semi-structured interviews were conducted with the Finnish company 
leaders/managers from various forest-based industries representing different branches in 
March-May 2017. Both mature FBS companies transforming towards new businesses and 
novel start-up companies were included in the study. Participating companies varied also in 
size and located in the different parts of the value network. Data will be examined using the 
thematic analysis method (Guest, 2012).  
Due to unfinished data analysis the results of the study and the details about the 
applied analytical framework cannot be presented at this point. However, the earlier 
developments and frameworks in the field of new/sustainable business models (e.g. 
Sustainable business model archetypes introduced by Bocken et al., 2014 and Architecture, 
principles and components in business models for sustainability presented by Wells, 2016) 
have offered useful elements for initial analysis of the data.  The key findings will be 
presented in the conference presentation.

Open innovation, absorptive capacity and 
strategic coopetition: An approach to the

Abstract 
This paper revisits the theoretical framework on innovation and recovers Zahra and George 
(2002)’s model of absorptive capacity and other related work, aiming to analyse a set of 
internal and liaison factors of the firm that affect firm-level absorptive capacity and 
entrepreneurial innovation capacity, in the context of open business models’ 
implementation in a strategic coopetition framework; to propose a new business model 
approach entitled: Open innovation bridge – a Tangram model; and to exemplify the 
identification of critical elements of the transactional structure of open innovation business 
models. 
As the firm is an open system, it is important to analyse internal firm-level factors that 
spur absorptive capacity, as well as the factors concerning resources and liaison flows used 
to absorb and communicate with external sources of knowledge, within a transactional 
structure rationale that needs further understanding in the context of open innovation 
business models. By mapping these factors, managers can design a more efficient open 
innovation business model in order to generate more innovation, at the firm level.  
In the empirical application, following the Tangram model (Leitão, 2017), an analysis of 
firm-level resources and transactional elements is provided, by making use of a dataset of 
571 service firms and 562 manufacturing firms which participated in the European 
Community Innovation Survey (CIS), 2010 (Eurostat, 2010). The results of a logistic 
regression analysis reveal that the resources represented by: acquisition of external 
knowledge and internal R&D activities; as well as the transactional elements, namely: 
cooperative liaison relationships with consultants and universities, plus external R&D 
activities; have a positive influence on the entrepreneurial innovation capacity, although

A Collaborative Energy System: 
 How Business Models of the Sharing 
Economy affect the Energy Sector 
Frederik Plewnia, Edeltraud Guenther, TU Dresden  
ema@mailbox.tu-dresden.de 
Keywords 
Sharing Economy, Collaborative Economy, Energy system Transition, Business Models 
Introduction and purpose 
As a result of the rapidly evolving digitalization, numerous new business models were born 
that are summarized under the umbrella term of a sharing economy. While sharing schemes 
are already disrupting the entertainment, hospitality, or mobility sector, lately, the sharing 
economy has also sparked vivid discussions about its impact on the energy sector (Haring, 
2016; Johnston, 2015). Joining in on this conversation, researchers have included the sharing 
economy in their analyses of new business models within the energy sector (Wainstein and 
Bumpus, 2016). The business activities discussed in this context range from peer-to-peer 
trading of energy within prosumer markets (Gstrein and Teufel, 2015) to centrally 
distributed cloud energy storage systems (Lombardi and Schwabe, 2017). 
The goal of this paper is to bring these two major topics - an evolving sharing economy 
and new business models within the transitioning energy system – together. For this 
purpose, a conceptual typology of sharing economy activities is developed that might help to 
understand and structure discussions on this topic. This typology is used to identify and 
examine business activities currently evolving in the energy industry which are related to 
sharing practices and discuss them for their implications for sustainable development. 
Methods 
To achieve the research goal outlined above, two steps are taken. First, a systematic review 
and a content analysis of literature on the sharing economy were conducted. As a result, a 
typology was developed that integrates 38 existing systematizations of sharing economy 
activities created by other researchers.  
Furthermore, new business models in the energy sector, which have recently been 
discussed in scientific articles, blogpost, reports, and on company or project websites, were 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
42 
identified. These new business models were then discussed for their conceptual 
intersections with developed framework of the sharing economy. 
Findings and results 
The four main dimensions of categorization identified for sharing economy activities are: 
shared good, market structure, market orientation, and industry sector. The dimension 
shared good comprises energy and material, redistribution of goods, product service 
systems (PSS), space, money, workforce, knowledge and skills, as well as information and 
data. The dimension market structure distinguishes business-to-consumer (B2C), consumer-
to-consumer 
(C2C), 
consumer-to-business 
(C2B), 
business-to-business 
(B2B) 
and 
government-to-consumer (G2C). The market orientation differentiates between for profit 
and non-profit transactions and the industry sector identifies sharing activities according to 
their industry field. 
Furthermore, together with the above introduced sharing categories, three meanings of 
the word sharing were found to co-exist within the realm of the sharing economy. Social 
sharing, also considered as ‘true sharing’ (Belk, 2014), is based on non-profit transactions, 
while economic sharing, associated with saving costs and resources, was found in for-profit 
transactions. Communicational sharing, in the sense of dissemination and multiplication of 
information and knowledge, was another form of sharing which was associated with the 
sharing economy. We found that there are many business activities in the energy sector 
which can be associated with economic sharing of goods and the communicational sharing 
of information. Social or ‘true’ non-profit sharing schemes are existing only on the margin of 
these business models.  
Conclusions 
According to the insights gained from this study, companies in the new energy system can 
choose to become B2C assets hubs in providing PSS services, they can become C2C, C2B, or 
B2B platforms aggregating and managing information and energy flows, or they can do both. 
This might create tendencies towards aggregation of power, information and know-how 
across the energy supply chain in the hands of new actors (Gauntlett, 2016). However, with 
reduced costs of renewable electricity generation as well as storage devices and the 
implementation of the blockchain-technology, social sharing schemes might increasingly 
gain importance in the future. (Benkler, 2004; Rifkin, 2014).  
The mentioned forms of business models within the transitioning energy system might 
have important implications for value creation not only for companies but also for society, 
and the environment. Paths of future research could include the investigation of social 
capital creation and resilience within economic as well as social sharing schemes, or the 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
43 
environmental impact of local C2C energy networks with or without back-up capacities on a 
larger scale. Another interesting avenue of investigation could include the decomposition 
and detailed analysis of sharing business models within the energy sector, based on their 
value creation, proposition and capture mechanisms.

Business models for optimizing urban solar 
energy use

Introduction and Purpose 
Solar energy technologies for heat and electricity still play a minor role in urban energy 
systems. Numerous benefits however, such as zero emissions of noise, greenhouse gases 
and air pollutants or the general availability of the energy source, make these technologies 
attractive for urban regions (Christian et al., 2011; Genske et al., 2009). To date, research on 
energy investment is biased towards homeowners or citizen participation initiatives (Hatzl et 
al. 2016), thereby neglecting more complex ownership structures which are characteristic 
for urban regions, i.e. joint ownership of residential buildings by several apartment owners. 
Facility managers usually assume an intermediate role between stakeholders, within 
owners/tenants of a multifamily house but also to external actors (e.g. third-party 
companies) and are also those who carry out refurbishments (Hopkins et al. 2016; 
Londerville 2012); therefore this group seems to be of particular relevance when it comes to 
solar energy adoption in multi-family buildings.  
Previous studies identify the type of building and its tenure as important factors, which 
influence energy investments in buildings (Heiskanen et al. 2016). The aim of this study 
therefore is to address this research gap and to answer the following questions: 
(1) What are current business models to implement solar projects in multi-family 
residential buildings?  
(2) What are problems and challenges that these projects are currently facing?  
(3) How do business models need to be designed to be more attractive for the 
peculiarity of solar projects for multi-family residential buildings?  
Methods 
Based on results from six explorative interviews with experts (e.g. representatives of facility 
management companies, politics, energy supply companies) and literature review, an 
online-survey was carried out amongst facility management companies in Austria in July 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
45 
2016 (n=47; response rate=4.7), aiming to identify companies which have experience with 
solar projects. Subsequently, semi-structured qualitative interviews are currently being 
carried out with representatives of these to gather detailed information about their solar 
projects. The interview guideline is based on the theoretical background of business model 
literature (e.g. business model CANVAS, (Osterwalder & Pigneur, 2010) and product service 
systems, (Tukker, 2004). It includes questions about the implementation process, actor 
constellation, business model elements (e.g. key activities and resources, customer 
relationship, channels, financial aspects, etc.), fostering/hindering aspects for implementing 
such projects, and the estimation of future progress. The interviews are conducted face-to-
face or by phone and last on average about an hour. All interviews are recorded, transcribed 
and analyzed by applying qualitative content analysis (Mayring, 2010) using the software 
tool MAXQDA.  
Preliminary Findings  
Different kinds of challenges exist for the different types of facility managers (single 
entrepreneurs, small & medium enterprises, large cooperative facility managers). Especially 
for single entrepreneurs solar projects bear difficulties in the sense that particular expertise 
is necessary for implementation. In larger cooperations, projects can be assigned to experts 
within the organization who have the necessary knowledge and experience. Using third-
party contractors for the implementation of such projects appears to be an obvious solution, 
however the available know-how in the market is still considered to be too low by facility 
managers to make it a worthwhile alternative. So far all surveyed facility mangers see a high 
relevance of solar technologies in multi-family residential buildings in the future; but only a 
small proportion sees themselves responsible for this change, depending on the different 
types of facility mangers (the larger the organization, the higher the willingness to 
offer/extend their service). Altering the legal context to make on-site solar energy more 
easily available for tenants might increase the relevance of solar installations for smaller 
facility mangers. 
Conclusions  
The research at hand contributes to a deeper understanding of currently used business 
models in the field of solar projects in multi-family houses. This includes the characterization 
of existing business models based on the CANVAS business model building blocks and the 
identification of challenges regarding the implementation of solar projects. Preliminary 
findings point to a gap between actual needs of facility managers who are willing to 
implement solar projects, and existing solutions in terms of business models. Especially lack 
of expertise in terms of technological possibilities, legal context and implementation process 
serve as clear barriers. Some of these barriers might be overcome with suitable business 
models, which, e.g., could take the form of product service systems (Tukker, 2004; Beuren et 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
46 
al., 2013) with a dominating service component. Thus, the research shows that the diffusion 
of solar technologies, in the field of more complex owner structures such as multi-family 
houses is limited because of lacking commercialized business models, which cover existing 
barriers. From a conceptual point of view, such business models need to consider multiple 
stakeholders and change the traditional perspective of a “customer-provider” perspective. 
Such new business models need to go beyond offering services just to end-users and target 
intermediaries like facility managers too. As this study is still ongoing, a clearer picture of 
existing business models, as well as requirements based on the needs potential adopters, 
will be available at the time of the conference.

Extended abstract  
The purpose of this research project is to consolidate the currently available knowledge 
about so-called business model patterns (Gassmann et al., 2014; Remane et al., 2017) that 
have the potential to support solutions to ecological and social problems, such as greener 
products, new mobility systems, or social enterprises (Short et al., 2012; Clinton & Whisnant, 
2014). This consolidation will lead to a new pattern taxonomy (Lambert, 2015) that can be 
used to support sustainable business model innovation (SBMI) and sustainability innovation 
(Boons & Lüdeke-Freund, 2013).  
In recent years, the value of using patterns to support business model development has 
been increasingly recognized and discussed in both research and practice. Already in 
Business Model Generation (2009), Osterwalder and Pigneur describe five business model 
patterns using the Business Model Canvas in an attempt to create a shared language similar 
to Alexander’s pattern language (Alexander et al., 1977; Leitner, 2015). Gassmann et al. 
(2014) identified 55 business model patterns as the basis for most business models that have 
been created over the last decades. And recently, Remane et al. (2017) consolidated current 
knowledge of conventional business model patterns into a database that can be used to 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
48 
support business model innovation. The use of patterns for sustainable business models is 
yet to be explored. This project intends to help close this gap.  
To start with, we define the notion of ‘sustainable business model pattern’ as follows: A 
sustainable business model pattern captures the similarities of sustainable business models 
that are repeatedly followed, i.e. similarities in terms of business model design principles, 
elements, and their arrangements. In doing so, a sustainable business model pattern 
illustrates an ecological, social, and/or economic problem that arises regularly when creating 
business cases for sustainability and describes the core of a solution that can be repeatedly 
applied in different ways. A sustainable business model pattern can either describe a 
complete business model or just a partial model (e.g. the financing model of a business 
model). 
To identify such patterns the first step was to review 14 studies proposing a total of 102 
potential SBM patterns. By deleting doublets and candidates that did not fully qualify as 
patterns in the sense of contextualised problem-solution combinations, we systematically 
identified a reduced set of 45 patterns ranging from eco-designed products and processes to 
social freemium models. In the second step, we used Alexander’s pattern template to 
describe these business model patterns in a consistent way. The third, currently ongoing 
step involves a Delphi survey combined with a physical card-sorting method (Paul, 2008) to 
arrange the 45 patterns in consistent and meaningful groups. This is necessary to develop a 
rigorous and relevant pattern taxonomy. Ten international experts from academia and 
business take part in our Delphi survey. We propose 12 initial groups to these experts and 
ask them to organise the patterns into these 12 groups to obtain a shared expert opinion on 
how to best classify the patterns. Once consensus emerges regarding the grouping of SBM 
patterns, we will set up the final SBM pattern taxonomy.  
The Delphi-based card-sorting is currently going on (as of March 2017). Its results and 
the first draft of our Sustainable Business Model Pattern Language will be presented at the 
2nd New Business Models Conference in Graz.

Business models strategies of frugal green 
technologies and innovations

Abstract 
In the current discussion about a sustainable development new business service concepts 
are highly required. Natarajan and Nancy (2012) argue for the intense customer relationship 
throughout the whole value process: “The system of products and services and its sales and 
distribution must be a co-operative enterprise between business and customer and 
customer should be major shareholder in value creations” (p. 8). Thus, the new 
understanding of value creation also requires new business models. However, Jagtap et al. 
(2014) argue that there are huge differences in design processes between BOP and 
industrialised markets. Defining the Base of the Pyramid (BOP), Webb et al. (2010) identified 
differences in market characteristics and stressed BOP markets depend less on country 
boundaries but on formal or informal market characteristics. So, comparable to poverty, 
there are (a) low levels of education, skills and capabilities, (b) weakly established 
infrastructure in urban areas and almost none in rural areas, (c) dominance of informal 
contracts and enforcement, and (d) minor property rights protection. In that sense, the 
differentiation between industrialised and developing countries is more than dysfunctional; 
BOP can be everywhere. Countries, mostly having higher levels of technology, education, 
expectation of life, basic services, food, etc. (further titled as countries of type I-I in order to 
avoid strongly valued and pejorative expression of developing countries or unilaterally 
economic defined definitions of countries or regions, e.g. World Bank, UN) are very different 
from countries developed otherwise, mostly having higher levels of poverty, specific 
diseases, less education and limited basic services and expectation in life (countries of type I-
II), in terms of innovation, technology, sustainability as well as cooperation with science 
(Rosca et al. 2016, Webb et al. 2010). Innovative products and services for low-income 
consumers, or even at BOP, base on new technologies and/or new business models (Bhatti 
et al. 2013), but seem to be very different. So, what are main characteristics of sustainable 
inclusive value creation and sustainability business models to mitigate social exclusion in 
BOP contexts? 
Innovations offered in I-II countries often do not cause technological breakthrough that 
drives innovation in I-I countries (Soni and Krishnan 2014, Brem and Wolfram 2014). BOP

solutions rather focus on unique combinations of existing knowledge and technologies on 
local scales (Govindarajan and Ramamurti 2011). In the literature, BOP markets are closely 
connected with inclusive value creation and frugal innovation. Frugal innovation refers to 
reduced complexity and reduced costs within the development and production process and 
significantly differs concerning the level of manufacturing compared to the steady state in 
the respective economic area (Rosca et al. 2016). Brem and Wolfram (2014) argue frugal 
innovations often focus on the specific needs of the BOP markets. This goes hand in hand 
with new technologies, new and innovative business models and/or value chain creations 
(Bhatti et al. 2013). Papaioannou (2014) stressed frugal innovations are mostly polycentric 
innovations stressing the diversity of actors and cross-country cooperation. Moreover, 
according to UNDP (2010: 18), inclusive strategies build bridges and imbed poor or BOP 
people “on the demand side as clients and customers and on the supply side as employees, 
producers and business owners at various points along value chains”. Thus, there is potential 
to mitigate social exclusion.  
George et al. (2012) stresses the possibility of inclusive innovations, business models 
and strategies for mitigating the trade-off between inequality and growth. From a policy 
perspective, inclusive strategies also foster sustainability. In the literature, inclusive or frugal 
innovation is somehow related with sustainability – often combining social and economic 
issues (Brem and Wolfram 2014, Bhatti et al. 2013); only some authors stress the need for a 
holistic analysis integrating all three dimensions of the triple-bottom line approach (Rosca et 
al. 2016, Gold et al. 2013). According to Brem and Wolfram (2014) frugal innovations can 
refer to sustainability, but do not have to. Rosca et al. (2016) argue for a conceptual 
separation of frugal innovation, sustainability and business model and stress inclusive 
approaches often highlight social and developmental concerns instead of ecological issues. 
However, are there different business models, different types of green technologies related 
to specific business models in the frugal context? George et al. (2012) highlights numerous 
theoretical approaches stressing inclusive growth by focusing on the limitations of current 
economic theories in BOP contexts. The theories of social and organizational networks are 
emphasised by the authors in order to understand new shapes of mixed partnership models 
like the partners’ strategies, actions and behaviour. Following the 3Cs framework of 
ecosystem research, the three main aspects context, configuration, capability (Rong et al. 
2015) are investigated in order to understand the characteristics, the complexity and 
dynamism of corporate strategies and sustainable business models in BOP contexts better. 
Applying the 3Cs framework, the research design is based on a combination of exploratory 
multiple case study design and cross-sectional design (Bryman 2015, Yin 2013) analysing 59 
cases of frugal green technologies and innovations stressing differences between 
entrepreneurs, multinational companies and NGOs as main players in BOP contexts. The 
research design is based on a combination of exploratory multiple case study design and 
cross-sectional design (Bryman 2015, Yin 2013). A qualitative research strategy is supported 
by descriptive statistics. For case selection a comprehensive case analysis was conducted. 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
52 
Data collection was based on text analysis, including different types of information, like 
papers, webpages, reports and other written data concerning the given case. Therefore, a 
database was used comprising keyword analysis and protocol (Bryman 2015, Yin 2013). 
Analysing the cases, different categorisations were used.  
First findings show that there are versatile and complex cooperation for creating frugal 
innovations. Companies operating on type I-II markets have to adopt their strategies and 
business models to serve the markets. Inclusive value creation and the inclusion of BOP 
people within the whole value creation, like product development, to procurement, 
production and distribution, enables social change and some mitigation of social exclusion. 
However, social engagement is mainly value-driven by SMEs and NGOs, but also MNCs 
invest in education, training and health service to enhance the employees’ capabilities. 
There are only three goals to highlight: Good health and well-being (goal 3), decent work 
and economic growth (8), and reduced inequalities (10). Moreover, there are various 
indirect effects, and only few direct contributions to the sustainability goals. Overall, the 
sustainability goals are not aimed at directly and comprehensively. Several limitations are 
given and further research is necessary: Diverse types of cases and data are mixed. The 
justification of case selection is based on the way the cases of the samples are investigated 
criteria-based and confirm the predefined item frugal innovation. Moreover, the 
representativeness of case selection can eclipse when cases can provide new knowledge or 
insights (Bryman 2015). The cross-sectional design was determined by the given data, so 
cases were not selected to balance industry selection but followed the frugal innovation 
criteria to secure the specific research focus. Furthermore, data collection was based on a 
single period, so that mid- or long-term effects of the respective sustainability effects of the 
innovations, their rebound or time-delayed effects could not be integrated within the 
analysis. Thus, a longitudinal design would be necessary.

“Is Time Money”? 
Implications of the Democratic Workplace 
for New Business Models

Objective(s) of the study/paper and its originality 
This papers aims to build a model for analytical participatory management, considering 
Galbraith’s (2002) business model dimensions, which includes Strategy, Structure, Processes, 
Rewards, and People. We intend to analyze the characteristics of a democratic company and 
the tools used to apply democracy on the workplace. The originality of the study is that we 
do not have in the literature a Brazilian business model for participatory management. 
Design/Methodology/Approach 
We used a qualitative case study method to analyze one representative case of Brazilian 
democratic workplace and participatory management: the Semco S.A. This company was 
completely rebuilt in the 1980’s by adopting a business model based on employee 
empowerment leadership. The data collected in the semi-structured interviews (n = 6) were 
analyzed by content analysis method to understand the elements behind the participatory 
management. 
Key Findings 
First, the findings showed the importance of the strategy for the participatory management. 
This dimension leads to two deployed elements: the leadership and the commitment-
efficiency trade-off. The idea is to show that a democratic environment demands much 
more time than an autocratic one (for example: time to discuss, time to find a “consensus”, 
time to plan an action in a collective decision, among others). The leadership has to do with 
a strong will of the CEO to maintain the participatory environment despite of the difficulties. 
Finally, the commitment-efficiency binomial represents a trade-off in the sense that the 
pursuit for organizational commitment jeopardizes the efficiency of decision making process, 
because democracy takes more time for voting and consensus.

Discussion 
This paper contributes both for practical and academic purposes. The limitations are related 
to the generation of a case study. To overcome the limits of the present paper, we 
encourage additional research including a wide number of companies, even though Semco is 
the most representative case of workplace democracy in Brazil. A multiple case study could 
allow the raise of variables to be tested in a quantitative research. Finally, this analysis could 
support the understanding of democratic workplaces in different organizational and cultural 
contexts.

Abstract 
In competitive context, every firm needs a strategy, no firm excluded. In competitive 
context, the achievement of goals is not depending just on the way a firm carries out its 
activities but also, and above all, on the way it carries out its activities compared to what 
others do. Strategy is about “looking outside” and trying to understand how to continuously 
reshape business model in order to catch opportunities and to prevent threats (Weber and 
Tarba 2014; Doz and Kosonen 2010). Over the last decades, globalization, technology 
convergence and innovation have made the economic environment more and more 
complex. Among this complexity the topic of sustainability (Amini and Bienstock, 2014; 
Baumgartner and Rauter, 2017; Lozano et al. 2015) has gathered momentum and has 
become one of the central issues into companies boardrooms (Baumgartner 2014). Starting 
from these premises it’s easy to assert that, nowadays, sustainability and, within the wide 
sustainability borders, the set of relationships a firm has built with its stakeholders (Freeman 
1984; Mitchell et al 1997) cannot be considered as an off-topic item within the strategizing 
process.Among the overall strategic planning process, business model (Baden-Fuller and 
Morgan, 2010; Chesbrough 2010; Zott and Amit 2008) is, by its nature, the point of contact 
between firm and stakeholders, i.e. between strategy and sustainability.For the aim of this 
paper we define business model as the set of choices related to the way in which a firm 
decides to implement its activities generating value. According to this view, business model 
can be seen as composed of two main classes of choices:  
1. the positioning of the firm within the business; 
2. the macro-architecture of the firm related both to internal items (internal 
stakeholders, resources, governance) and external items (position within the value 
chain, external stakeholders, cooperative Vs competitive relationships).

Several frameworks rooted in strategic management debate propose the integration of 
corporate sustainability with strategy (Baumgartner 2014; Baumgartner and Rauter 2017; 
Engert and Baumgartner, 2016; Rauter et al 2017). Added to that, by the reporting side we 
are experiencing several attempts to integrate strategy and sustainability (Adams 2015; 
Beattie and Smith 2013). Starting from the strategic management discourse around business 
model definition, the paper is aimed at suggesting a method to assess the nature and quality 
of the relationships the firm has with its stakeholder through its business model.More in 
details, the paper is aimed at identifying and evaluating, by the use of qualitative and 
quantitative criteria, the nature of the relationships a firm has built with its stakeholders 
analyzing the role played by each of them in the process of strategy implementation and 
realization (by the means of business model).Starting from the work of Mitchell (1997) that 
defines stakeholder salience on the base of the possess of three main attributes (power, 
legitimacy and urgency) the paper adds the strategic functionality dimension, intended as 
the role played by each stakeholder in strategy implementation – realization.Through the 
combination of the two dimensions, level of salience (i.e. behavioural attitude of 
stakeholders) and strategic functionality (i.e. role played by each stakeholder in strategy 
implementation - realization) the paper maps the nature and features of the stakeholders 
and the role they could play in influencing (positively or negatively) firm’s strategy 
realization.  
 
 
Figure 1: Stakeholder map 
The paper begins with a review of the theoretical background that frames the analysis 
with particular reference to the strategy-stakeholder relationship (Baumgartner 2014; 
Baumgartner and Rauter 2017; Engert and Baumgartner 2016; Rauter et al 
2017).Subsequently, the study develops its analysis by means of a case study, a method 
widely used in management studies (Yin, 1984; Eisenhardt, 1989; Berg, 2009) because of its 

 
NBM@Graz2017

ability to provide the qualitative evaluations that are particularly useful when analysing 
company strategy. Through the case study, adopting a dynamic perspective, the paper 
analyzes the role played by each kind of stakeholder in the process of strategy 
implementation and realization (by the means of business model), over a specific time 
horizon (5 years).  
The case study is based on primary information coming from authors’ interviews of 
company management and from a survey purposely appointed to get both qualitative and 
quantitative insights of the relationships the firm built with stakeholder over the years.This 
is a preliminary study aimed at investigating the strategy-stakeholder tie, focusing on the 
relationships built by the firm through its business model.  
It contributes to the existing literature (Haslam et 2015, Mitchell 1997) by adding a new 
dimension to the Mitchell work (1997) stressing the role of business model as the main point 
of contact between firm and stakeholders. At the same time, the paper suggests a 
managerial tool, useful to better drive the effectiveness of strategy realization through a 
better understanding of the role played by each stakeholder in strategy realization (i.e. 
business model implementation).  
Future studies should implement other real cases in order to verify and deepen the 
business model – stakeholders relationships and the manner in which enterprises should 
manage them to realize their strategy.

Case study of how one Australian company is 
implementing and managing the B Corp 
model  
Wendy Stubbs, Monash University, Australia 
wendy.stubbs@monash.edu 
Introduction and Purpose 
Hybrid business models are emerging that prioritise positive social and environmental 
outcomes (Haigh & Hoffman, 2014). Social enterprises, which seek to solve social problems 
through business ventures (Smith, et al., 2013) are examples of these types of models. B 
Corps are a more recent example of a hybrid business model that attempts to align profit 
and societal impact and prioritises positive social and environmental outcomes (Stubbs, 
2017a). B Corps are described as for-profit, socially obligated, corporate forms of business, 
with traditional corporate characteristics but also with societal commitments (Hiller, 2013). 
While little research has been conducted on B Corps, they provide interesting sites for 
studying how organizations integrate for-profit and for-purpose considerations into their 
business model (Stubbs, 2017b). 
The aim of this paper is to present the results of a case study of an Australian B Corp. 
The objectives of the study were to: examine how a B Corp integrates for-purpose and for-
profit considerations into its business model, including its vision/mission/purpose, strategy, 
structure and business practices; and, explore any tensions in integrating for-profit and for-
purpose logics in the B Corp model. 
Research Methods  
The study used in-depth, semi-structured interviews with an Australian certified B Corp in 
order to understand how it is implementing the B Corp model and the tensions that arise. 
The B Corp operates in the financial services sector and primarily provides products and 
services to not-for-profit (NFP) organizations. Its vision is to strengthen NFPs and assist them 
to deliver social change and community wellbeing. 13 people across different functional 
areas were approached for an interview and 7 agreed to participate in the study. The 
interviews were of the duration of 60 to 75 minutes and were conducted during February – 
May 2016. All interviews were recorded (with consent) and transcribed to aid the analysis

The transcribed interviews were coded and refined into categories to draw out key 
themes. The process involved open coding, axial coding and selective coding (Strauss & 
Corbin, 1998). The institutional logics literature was used to analyse the key themes. 
Research Findings 
In many respects the B Corp model reflects the ‘hybrid ideal’ (Battiliana, et al., 2012) where 
everything the hybrid does produces both social value and commercial value and employees 
do not work on separate for-profit or for-purpose activities. The B Corp makes its money 
from selling products and services to the not-for-profit sector to enable NFPs to drive 
positive societal impacts. It does not rely on generating revenue in one part of the 
organization to finance social impact projects in another part of the organization. However, 
while the for-profit and for-purpose logics are strongly integrated in some aspects of the B 
Corp’s operations (vision, recruitment, communications and marketing), trying to balance 
these two logics has created tensions and conflict in other areas (ownership structure, 
performance measurement, sales and distribution, product design and development). These 
tensions, coupled with the founding CEO pursuing a strategy strongly aligned with the for-
purpose logic, have hindered performance but are now instigating change in two main areas. 
One is repositioning the strategy. The other is the incentives system. A framework that 
classifies the types of tensions that arose and the management approaches observed to deal 
with these tensions is summarised in Table 1.

The study highlights the organizational challenges that arise from having to deal with 
incompatibilities between for-profit and for-purpose logics in hybrid business models, and 
how organizations respond. Its main contribution is to increase understanding of how to 
implement business models that combine for-profit and for-purpose considerations in 
response to calls for more research into new organizational forms that are breaking down 
traditional boundaries (Zietsma, et al., 2014).

Business Models as Activity Systems: 
Unravelling multiple value creation in 
organizations.

Abstract 
This paper contributes to the debate on New Business Models and multiple value creation in 
Organizations. We aim to clarify the idea of multiple value creation in organizations through 
the lens of Activity Theory. In this perspective business models are seen as an activity 
system. A literature review will be deployed to investigate and harness this perspective. 
There is a vivid debate on how organizations contribute to valuing Sustainable Development 
given their social and environmental impact. In this debate, we understand value from a 
capital-based view. According to this view, capitals are seen as valuable productive human 
and physical resources. Value creation is shaped by 1) the intrinsic value of resources and 2) 
the way (human) activities are being organized.  
We are observing a stream of literature, addressing issues on how value creation in 
organizations takes place. A school of thought in this field focuses on the concept business 
model by means of which organizations are able to profit through the provision of products 
or services. The business model-concept is regarded as a conceptual frame for the 
development of business systems and business architecture; as such it describes 
mechanisms through which value can be created and captured. The literature shows that 
the dominant business model-concept is based on the Osterwalder business model-
ontology. The ontology is archetypical for a business model logic that strives to realize 
economic value and to maximize shareholder value. The embedded neo-classical logic of 
value creation hinders the simultaneously creation of social, environmental and economic 
value. In this perspective the meaning of value creation is being reduced to economic value 
in the sense of financial profit. We conclude that a business model logic that strives to 
realize primarily economic value and maximize shareholder value is not supportive to 
multiple value creation in organizations. Our aim is to propose to a business model logic that 
supports multiple value creation in organizations.

An activity system-approach that provides a framework to study a business model as a 
collective activity system seems to be a more appropriate theoretical lens. Central notions in 
this approach are 1) that human activity is a social activity per se, 2) that activity is collective 
and meets the needs of the community and 3) that activity is driven by a communal motive. 
As a consequence, value creation studied through an activity system-lens will provide 
attention to value as a collective feature, meeting the needs of the community. We expect 
that value creation is not limited to the realization of economic value and of shareholder 
value alone. 
In this paper, we will report on the execution of a structured and extensive literature 
search. This will not only cover management sciences but will be expanded in the fields of 
psychology and learning. It will be based on a set of keywords to define value creation in 
organizations, business models and activity theory. Secondary objective is to use 
combinations of keywords identifying the relation between business models and multiple 
value creation. This might provide the basis for new insights and knowledge. The search will 
be conducted using Mendeley software. As an overall result we will provide a review of the 
state of the art in knowledge in the field of multiple value creation in organizations, business 
models and activity theory. The literature review will be used for further empirical research.

Introduction and background 
This study explores a new practical approach for helping innovation leaders to design better 
value propositions that result in more sustainable businesses. It develops a new tool for 
supporting the development and communication of value propositions to multiple change 
stakeholders of business model transformations. Integrating sustainability into business 
models requires a systemic view that considers the global perspective of the system (Stubbs 
and Cocklin, 2008). Despite recent entrants like the ©The Sustainable Value Analysis Tool 
(Yang, Vladimirova and Evans, 2017) and ©The Cambridge Value Mapping Tool (for full 
collaboration see Vladimirova, 2016), there is still a paucity of tools that can be used by 
companies to evaluate and design the business case for sustainability successfully 
(Schaltegger et al., 2012) and carry out successful business model transformations 
(Vladimirova, 2012). 
The paper introduces a new tool, the Value Proposition Builder, which assists industry 
users by providing a step-by-step structured approach for creating value propositions for 
multiple change stakeholders of their business to support the development of or the 
transformation towards new business models. The tool can be used alongside other 
sustainable business model innovation tools to create a more comprehensive innovation 
process. 
Methodology 
This study applies multiple theoretical perspectives from the fields of business model 
innovation for sustainability (Evans et al., 2017), sustainable value creation (Hart and 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
69 
Milstein, 2003), Service-Dominant logic (Frow and Payne, 2011), stakeholder networks 
(Svendsen and Laberge, 2005) and business transformation (Vladimirova, 2012) to identify a 
practical approach for integrating the concepts of ‘value proposition’, ‘change stakeholders’ 
and ‘sustainability’.  
The research strategy is engaged scholarship (Van de Ven and Johnson, 2006; Van de 
Ven, 2007) which is a means of collaborative inquiry between industry practitioners and 
academics. The study develops a structured method and a practical tool to facilitate the 
development of value propositions for stakeholders of the business in practice. The tool was 
tested in a workshop with 30 industry participants grouped in six international collaborative 
inter-disciplinary project teams within a global digital services market leader. In the 
workshop, each project team had to develop multiple value propositions, as part of the 
development of a business case to their customers, the company top management, and 
other project-specific internal and external key stakeholder that could enable or prevent the 
proposed change, as identified by the participants. 
Results  
A new tool was developed: The Value Proposition Builder (Figure 1). The purpose of the tool 
is to outline a practical method for co-creating value propositions for multiple change 
stakeholders of the business model. The tool takes participants through the following 
process: 
 Define the unit of analysis – a new value opportunity, e.g. product, service, project 
which could lead to a change in the existing business model or to the creation of a 
new business model. 
 Identify key change stakeholders of the new value opportunity, i.e. stakeholders who 
will enable or prevent successful change, which might include customers, decision-
makers, partners, suppliers, environment (e.g. resource availability), society. 
 Describe the benefits from the new value opportunity for each change stakeholder, 
e.g. problems that the new value opportunity solves for each stakeholder. 
 Describe the contributions from and the responsibilities of each change stakeholder 
for the realisation of the new value opportunity.  
 Identify a common theme on how value is created for all stakeholders. 
 Develop a value proposition for each stakeholder.

Conclusions 
This paper contributes to the field of sustainable business models by increasing the 
understanding of how multiple stakeholder value propositions which enable successful 
business model transformations could be developed in practice. A new tool, which facilitates 
organisations in better understanding the value from new ideas, products or services and 
the contributions from their stakeholders, could help build and communicate targeted value 
propositions. The tool also enables industrialists to enhance competitive advantage through 
the economic, social and environmental attributes of sustainable value. This tool forms part 
of ©The Business Transformation Tools suite developed from Vladimirova (2012).

Extended Abstract: Introduction  
New, sustainable business models can address economic, environmental and social issues 
(Boons & Lüdeke-Freund, 2013). Research on the role of such business models in supporting 
wider societal change and transition processes is however still in an early phase (Bidmon & 
Knab, 2014, and Huijben et al., 2016). While it has been acknowledged that business models 
enable the upscaling of new, sustainable technologies by removing various investment 
barriers, this has so far not been explicitly considered from a transition studies systemic 
perspective.  
An empirical case study was conducted on business models for car sharing in Sydney, 
Australia. The Australian government is interested in business models that make large cities 
more environmentally friendly. The City of Sydney, with problems such as limited parking 
space and heavy traffic congestion, considers car sharing as an option to make the city 
‘green, global and connected’ (City of Sydney, 2015).  
Car sharing is thus perceived promising for making the transition to a more sustainable 
mobility regime. Despite whether its sustainability will be proven or not, car sharing business 
models are part of a niche that is still under development.  

 
NBM@Graz2017

The aim of the research is to identify the regime barriers for an urban mobility transition 
and to examine the role of new car sharing business models in overcoming these. Here, we 
define the regime as the mainstream private car transportation system in place consisting of 
various dimensions: culture, consumer practices, infrastructure, industrial networks, 
technology and scientific knowledge, and policy (Geels, 2002). This leads to the following 
research question: how can new (car sharing) business models conquer the barriers imposed 
by the existing mobility regime thereby enabling the up-scaling of this mobility niche?  
Methodology 
The qualitative research conducted for this study builds upon a comparative case study 
between two different types of business models in the city of Sydney: peer-to-peer car 
sharing and traditional car sharing. Both business models were commercially operating at 
the time of the study (2015). The research involved an iterative process of study, including a 
desktop and literature study, and interviews with main car sharing stakeholders. The 
transcribed interviews were coded and structured based on content analysis. Overall, data 
analysis exploits the constructionist ontology juxtaposing different business models and the 
regime context (Hardy, Harley, & Phillips, 2004). 
Findings  
With regard to the development of a car sharing system in Sydney, barriers were formed by 
the dominant logic (i.e. private car use) within the regime. The results of the study are 
summarized in Table 1. Several regime dimensions and their elements were identified, and 
for each regime element we found the business models to either align to it or not. For 
example, there is an initial fit or alignment on the infrastructural regime dimension in the 
case of the old car infrastructure, since the business models ‘borrow’ this infrastructure for 
their own use. When a business model is not aligned, an individual business model can 
overcome the trust barrier in the cultural regime dimension by managing expectations of 
their customers and including a feedback reputation system in their value proposition 
(Business Model Innovation). Additionally, in the policy dimension, there is a lack of parking 
spaces dedicated to sharing. Traditional car sharing companies have close ties with the 
government who can assist in overcoming this barrier. A general regulation on dedicated 
parking spaces for sharing is eventually beneficial for the whole niche.  
Conclusion 
Results show that there are three types of niche business model and regime interplay. First 
of all, the study showed that there is some fit between the private car regime and the car 
sharing business models. Next to this, there are two different strategies for dealing with 
regime barriers. There is a strategy focusing on the internal organizational part of the 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
74 
business model (i.e. Value Proposition and Customer Segment). The other strategy is on the 
contextual level, where the business can use their network to alter the context for the new 
business models (e.g lobbying for transformation of regulations). Both strategies can lead to 
new business opportunities for the entire niche or only the company itself.

Abstract 
The concept of a circular economy (CE) has become increasingly popular in the recent years 
(Zhu, 1998; Ghisellini, Cialani and Ulgiati, 2014; Lieder and Rashid, 2015; Ellen Macarthur 
Foundation, 2015). This concept requires transition from a linear model toward a circular 
model of material management (Bonciu, 2014; Andersen, 2007; Happaerts, 2014). The 
latter, in contrast with the linear model (Ness, 2008), considers waste as a resource that can 
be used in the production process (Sauvé, Bernard and Sloan, 2015). Building a CE, i.e. the 
circular model of material management, requires attention on the entire life-cycle of the 
product: from products to materials (Ellen Macarthur Foundation, 2012; Yap, 2005). 
Therefore, each step between the extraction of materials and the end of life of products is 
taken into account in order to build up a CE (Jawahir and Bradley, 2016). However, 
sustainable waste management remains the keystone for implementing the concept of the 
circular model of material management (Ghisellini, Cialani and Ulgiati, 2014). Moreover, the 
sustainable waste management becomes a key one to build up a CE in the European Union 
(EU) and support the sustainable development through decreasing environmental problems 
and economic losses for society and creating green jobs (Bonciu, 2014; Ghisellini, Cialani and 
Ulgiati, 2014; European Commission, 2014; Christis et al, 2015; Sauvé, Bernard and Sloan, 
2015). Therefore, the use of sustainable business models for waste management is one of 
the important tools for the creation of such kind of economy (Witjesa and Lozano, 2016). 
However, not every sustainable business model could be considered as a circular one (Van 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
78 
Ostaeyen et al, 2013). This is because not every sustainable model could close the loop in 
the production process of a firm (as in our case study) through introduction of product-
service systems (Tukker and Tischner, 2006; Van Ostaeyen et al, 2013). However, the circular 
business models could be defined as a part of sustainable business models. 
Building up a circular economy is a complex process that involved various players and 
organizations from different economic levels (micro, meso and macro) and sectors (Ellen 
Macarthur Foundation, 2015; Yuan, Bi and Moriguichi, 2006). This is also valid for 
sustainable waste management that is based on a particular sustainable business model. In 
our paper, we focus on packaging waste stream as an important one from all household 
waste streams (Fost Plus, 2008). Moreover, in our case, the sustainable business model is 
implemented by a particular organization (e.g. Fost Plus in Belgium and ЕcoPack in Bulgaria) 
for managing a packaging management system. In other words, one organization 
implements a sustainable business model for managing of packaging management system 
that is built from different firms having their own business models (Seelos and Mair, 2007; 
Yunus, Moingeon and Lehmann-Ortega, 2010; Massa and Tucci, 2014). The aim of our paper 
is to present the two main sustainable business models for packaging waste management 
applied in the EU and to find out the factors under which these models could be used 
optimally. Hence, the sustainable business model applied in Belgium and this one 
implemented in Bulgaria are presented and analyzed. These two countries are chosen due to 
several reasons. The two main of them are the following: first, they are appropriate samples 
for presenting the two main sustainable business models used in the EU; second, Belgium is 
considered to be amongst the most (eco)efficient countries for packaging waste 
management in Europe, whereas Bulgaria is amongst the less (eco)efficient EU counties in 
this field. This facilitates the aim of our study. 
To conduct our research, we used one case-study method (Yin, 2003). Our explorative 
case-study research is guided by the following research problem: “How can the sustainable 
business models for packaging waste management be used optimally in EU countries to 
achieve higher social, environmental and economic results?” To approach this research 
problem, we used semi-structured interviews, as they leave space for respondents to give 
personal explanations of the issues under study (Brewerton and Millward, 2001; Yin, 2003). 
The interviews last more than an hour and are generally held with a single respondent. A 
diversified group of 24 waste experts were selected for our study. These respondents were 
selected according to two main criteria: (1) their knowledge on waste management 
(separate waste collection and recycling); and (2) their varied perspectives on sustainable 
waste management and effectiveness of packaging collections, processing and recycling. 
They were chosen from 24 leading organizations in the field: 12 organizations from Belgium 
(e.g. Fost Plus, OVAM, EXPRA) and 12 organization from Bulgaria (e.g. ЕcoPack Bulgaria, 
EcoBulpack, Bulgarian Association of Recycling). We selected these organizations from the 
three basic sectors (public sector, private sector and voluntary sector) in order to gather

wider and unbiased information related to our research. To enhance data validity and 
reliability, interview data (primary information) have been complemented with other 
sources of evidence, such as articles, reports, and policy documentations (secondary 
information).  
By comparing Bulgarian and Belgium business models for packaging waste 
management, we found out the obstacles that hinder successful implementation of the 
Bulgarian business model and the drivers that lead to successful application of the Belgium 
one (and optimal recycling results as well). Thus, we highlight the factors that could affect 
positively (drivers) or negatively (obstacles) the using of such kind of models. We also 
present some suggestions for overcoming the obstacles that curb the achievement of 
efficient and optimal recycling results in Bulgaria. In conclusion, the results of our study 
could facilitate better use of sustainable business models for packaging waste management. 
Thus, we contribute to the literature of sustainable business models and packaging waste 
management.

The role of networks in business model 
innovation: 
Three shaping processes supporting cognitive shifts

Abstract 
Scholars regard the implementation of sustainability-oriented innovations  as a business 
model challenge (Boons, Montalvo, Quist and Wagner, 2013; Schaltegger, Lüdeke-Freund 
and Hansen, 2012). Business model innovation is regarded as an important instrument for 
commercializing new ideas and emerging technologies (Chesbrough, 2010; Spieth, 
Schneckenberg and Picart, 2014), for innovative technologies do not in itself have economic 
value, but incorporate latent value that may be commercialised by the business model 
(Chesbrough & Roosenbloom, 2002).  
One of the functions of the business model is supporting management in defining and 
developing the firm’s strategy (Spieth et al., 2014). The business model is further seen to be 
developed through creating encounters with potential users and possible partners (Boons & 
Lüdeke-Freund, 2013; Doganova & Eyquem-Renault, 2009). Stakeholders and in particular 
(potential) customers are an important source for business model innovation (Spieth et al., 
2014). Especially for sustainable business models, stakeholder integration may radically 
change the business logic and help to revise the business model (Schaltegger et al., 2012). In 
respect to strategic decisions and adaptation of business models cognition plays a central 
role (Foss & Saebi, 2017; Spieth et al., 2016), challenging basic assumptions, including the 
belief system, and changing the dominant logic (Cavalcante, Kesting and Ulhøi, 2011; Doz 
and Kosonen, 2010; Tikkanen, Lamberg, Parvinen and Kallunki, 2005). How cognitive change 
reframes the dominant logic (Cavalcante et al., 2011; Spieth et al., 2016), and how 
stakeholders are integrated into business model innovation need further research (Massa, 
Tucci and Afuah, 2014; Spieth, Schneckenberg and Matzler, 2016).  
In this study we focus on interfirm-level collaboration of actors in business model 
innovation (Spieth et al., 2016). Our research approach is a multiple case study design, 
enabling within-case analysis and cross-case synthesis, using pattern matching logic for 
explanation building (Yin, 2013). We build on three cases concerning sustainability-oriented 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
83 
innovations, each case constituting a cognitive shift that resulted in a fundamental redesign 
of the business model, including the value proposition. The data consists of 12 semi-
structured interviews, and 82 additional data sources. We closely look at the 
commercialisation stage in which a change of cognition and redesign of the business model 
take place, and create codes for value creation activities and the roles different partners play 
in these activities, prior and after the change occurs. 
Our findings show that interaction with the network contributes to business model 
development in two different ways. The cognitive shift in the entrepreneurs’ mind, emerges 
from external barriers (e.g. reluctance of potential customers to adopt the innovation, and 
new competition), and changes his perception of the added value of his innovation for 
different stakeholders. Based on an analysis of the encounters that take place, the roles that 
partners play and the activities that are collaboratively undertaken, we find that this 
cognitive shift consists by three processes that are interrelated and support business model 
innovation. Each type of shaping consists of different activities and involves different 
partners in different roles: 
 Product/service offerings shaping. (Re)shaping the offering that ascertain optimal 
customer value creation through interaction with (potential) end customers and 
complementary partners, e.g. changing from delivering functionality towards 
creating total solutions; 
 Credibility shaping. Employing the companies network to enhance the credibility of 
the value proposition, e.g. changing from collecting evidence, towards gaining 
legitimacy; 
 Market approach shaping. (Re)shaping the market interface and go-to-market 
strategy in collaboration with strategic partners, e.g. changing from technology push 
towards market pull.  
The findings add to the business model literature by showing how stakeholder 
integration contributes to changing the dominant logic in business model innovation (Spieth 
et al., 2014). The three processes can be viewed as an extension of the process of distancing, 
abstracting and reframing as proposed by Doz and Kosonen (2010). They provide a deeper 
understanding of the business model innovation process, by showing what type of activities 
and kind of partnerships may contribute to redesign business models to adapt to the market, 
and by showing how firms may co-create business models (Spieth et al., 2016). The main 
contribution of this paper is a conceptual framework with a cognitive shift supported by 
three interrelated shaping processes that provide a fine-grained perspective on value 
creation through collaborative networks. It allows academics to further study the role of 
cognition in business model innovation, the roles specific partners play in each shaping 
process, and how entrepreneurs can organise the activation of the three processes.

Human Capital Management in Support of 
Sustainable Business Model Innovations: 
A Systematic Review

Abstract 
Managing organizational change for sustainability most probably is one of the biggest 
challenges for the companies of the 21st century.  It is possible to suggest that finding 
effective ways for managing organisational change (Millar, Hind & Magala, 2012) have 
become a critical topic for many organisational sustainability development programs. In 
order to realize these innovations, organizations need to possess a mix of resources and 
capabilities (Bowen, et al., 2001; Darnall and Edwards, 2006). This mix includes the human 
capital (HC) related capabilities as well. However, having these capabilities is not enough as 
Penrose (1959) has suggested but the ways they are used add value to the organization. In 
those organizations that aim for sustainability innovation, human resource management’s 
(HRM) goal should be to support the organization in adopting new business models. 
Essentially how human side is managed in organizations can determine the success of 
sustainability oriented innovations. 
Accepting the understanding that depletion of resources without replacing them is a 
major concern for sustainability, sustainable HRM aims to develop and rejuvenate human 
and social capital for the organization and also for the society (Kramar, and Mariappanadar, 
2015; Buller  and McEvoy, 2016). Sustainable HRM pertains to two domains in which support 
to organizational sustainability is provided through HC management practices and the HRM 
processes themselves becoming more sustainable (Ehnert, Parsa, Roper, Wagner and 
Muller-Camen, 2016). Sustainable HRM should consider the value creation logic of the 
organization and take into account the external stakeholders as well. This perspective 
defines business outcomes beyond economic outcomes to include economic, social and 
ecological outcomes for multiple stakeholders (Kramar, 2014). In this way sustainable HRM 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
86 
can also be in line with business model of the organization for sustainability (Schaltegger, 
Hansen, and Lüdeke-Freund, 2016).  
The study aims to review the HC management capabilities that support sustainable 
business model innovations (SBMI) in organizations. The systematic review approach is 
adopted in order to increase transparency and bring focus to the study (Seuring and Müller, 
2008). The time period of the study is chosen to be the last twenty years as SBMI and 
sustainable/green human resource practices were conceptualized and researched in that 
time period (1997-2017). The six step model of systematic review as defined in Klewitz, and 
Hansen’s (2014) work is adopted. Firstly, two clouds are selected (human capital and 
sustainable business model innovation) guided by the research question and in the next step 
relevant keywords were determined in light of the previous literature reviews and the 
theme of the research. Next, search has been conducted using five databases, only selecting 
peer reviewed academic articles that are written in English. Resulting 184 articles were 
sorted into three groups from most relevant to not relevant by going through the abstracts. 
Following this step, the most relevant and informative 20 articles were selected by reviewing 
the main body of the articles. Inductive thematic analysis was conducted on these articles.  
The results of the review firstly present quantitative descriptive analysis of the articles 
examined; the data is presented in terms of journals, time period, geography, methods of 
study and theories used. The demographic analysis highlights the rising importance of the 
SBMI concept in the last decade. The second part of the analysis presents the results of the 
thematic analysis answering the research question. The human capital management 
capabilities are sorted by using four stages of SBMI that are development, implementation, 
controlling and assessment. The HC management capabilities are found be more for the first 
stages of the model, and almost absent for the last stage. Building sustainability oriented 
innovation teams, top management support, building trust among team members, 
increasing employee engagement, outsourcing, knowledge sharing learnt from external 
stakeholders are some of these human capital management related capabilities. The results 
direct future studies in exploring HC management capabilities in relation to SMBI, 
particularly during controlling and assessment stages.

The missing link in business models for 
sustainability? 
Lessons from the sharing economy 
Raz Godelnik 
Parsons School of Design – The New School, 66 Fifth Ave 
New York, NY 10011 USA  
godelnir@newschool.edu 
Abstract 
The sharing economy has provoked interest in part because it offers possible avenues to 
sustainability (Martin, 2016). By enabling consumers to conveniently and affordably access 
goods rather than own them, the sharing economy unlocks the value in excess capacity, 
allowing society to use resources more efficiently (Chase, 2015). Whether this potential is 
realized remains to be seen (Frenken & Schor, 2017), but many peer-‐‐to-‐‐peer platforms do 
operate what appear to be business models for sustainability (BMfS).  
In this paper, I use case studies from the sharing economy to assess the drivers behind 
BMfS development, in specific corporate contexts. These contexts are worth exploring 
because, as BMfS scholars argue, sustainable business models are manifestations of 
organizations’ sustainability strategies (Lüdeke-Freund et al., 2016). Applying Schein’s (2010) 
argument that strategies are determined by organizational culture, I ask whether indeed 
organizational culture has significant influence over the creation and character of new BMfS.  
In order to address this question, I compare three ride-‐‐hailing services—Uber, Lyft, and 
Juno. Using publicly available data, I evaluate each according to Boons and Lüdeke-‐‐Freund’s 
(2013) BMfS framework, which considers customer value propositions, business 
infrastructures, customer interfaces, and financial models. I also apply an organizational-‐‐
culture model based on Schein (2010) and Graham et al. (2016).   
These ride-‐‐hailing platforms were created to meet similar customer needs, but my 
analysis finds differences in their business models and sustainability outcomes. The findings 
suggest that organizational culture in fact does shape these platforms’ approaches to 
sustainability, with consequences. I also detect a strong connection between founders’ 
mindsets—defined as “the assumptions and expectations we have for ourselves and others 
that guide our behavior” (Goldstein & Brooks, 2007)—and organizational cultures, 
suggesting that founders play pivotal roles in the creation and development of new BMfS. 
Scholars increasingly recognize that organizational culture and founders’ values affect the 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
89 
development of BMfS (Lüdeke-Freund et al., 2016), but the extent of their impact is not yet 
clear.  
Finally, I consider the applicability of my findings to new enterprises outside the sharing 
economy. Sundararajan (2014) argues that the organizational cultures of sharing-‐‐economy 
firm lack “the directive authority or co-located social systems that traditional firms can take 
advantage of to manage their employees.” But my analysis shows that, despite this, the 
corporate cultures of sharing-economy firms still shape outcomes in ways much like those of 
other startups.  
My results suggest that the sustainability impact of the sharing economy is contingent 
on organizational culture and on founders. Future research on the development of BMfS 
should therefore attend to these factors, alongside the business drivers already identified in 
sustainable business models. 
Ultimately, I argue that there is an opportunity to apply the lessons from the sharing 
economy’s emerging enterprises into a BMfS framework that incorporate the human 
influences I isolate. Indeed, businesses in general, not just those participating in the sharing 
economy, can benefit from a better understanding of the mindset-‐‐culture-‐‐ strategy 
connections in BMfS to foster sustainable change.

Abstract 
It is widely argued that business models constitute an important link between a sustainable 
technology and the market (c.f. Boons and Lüdeke-Freund, 2013). The literature on business 
models and business models for sustainability, however, has often pleaded for a stable 
model once it is developed rather than viewing the adaption of a business model to different 
circumstances or the continuous change due to changing circumstances associated with the 
adaptive transformation that characterize sustainable development (Roome and Louche, 
2016). Still the most successful business models are considered role models ready to be 
copied or imitated (c.f. Baden-Fuller and Morgan, 2010). In addition, Foss and Saebi, (2017) 
argue for further need of more research on contingency and moderating variables (macro-, 
firm- and microlevel moderators) influencing business model innovation. 
In California has the third party ownership (TPO) business model, a scalable and efficient 
business model platform allowing consumers to “go solar” without upfront costs and with 
maintenance and system guarantees over 20 years, rapidly developed during the last decade 
(Overholm, 2017). This, on a US scale, successful TPO business model is currently being 
introduced in a number of European markets, where upfront purchases of systems and local 
entrepreneurs have been dominating. Researchers studying business models for solar 
energy have, however, pointed to potential challenges for the TPO business model to spread 
to markets outside the US, suggesting that differing customer characteristics and

environmental setting might influence its success (Overholm, 2017; Strupeit and Palm, 
2016). 
In this paper we employ a multiple case study approach to analyze the TPO business 
model spreading in space and time to new markets to enrich the debate on business model 
adaption as well as the debate on bringing business models for sustainability to new 
markets. Embedded in the business model for sustainability and business model innovation 
literature we examine macro level factors shaping a business model for solar energy to 
residential customers when travelling from California to three distinct European markets: 
Netherlands, Sweden and Germany. The research question guiding the study is: “How do 
market characteristics influence the business model spread into new markets?”  
The paper will provide empirical evidence and a deeper knowledge of how macro level 
moderators influence business models travelling into new markets and align with new 
circumstances, as sought after in the business model literature (Baden-Fuller and Morgan, 
2010; Foss and Saebi, 2017), and thereby providing better chances for bringing sustainable 
technologies to the market. Following the guiding principles on business models for 
sustainability (Jonker, 2016), this paper contributes both to collaborative value creation and 
multiple value creation as the business model is seen as a framework allowing us to better 
understand how a sustainable technology can create sustainable value on a new market.

Multibusiness, decentralized companies and 
transitions to sustainable business models 
FRANCESCA CIULLI* & ANS KOLK 
UNIVERSITY OF AMSTERDAM BUSINESS SCHOOL, THE NETHERLANDS

Abstract 
Over the last years scholars have increasingly explored firms’ transition towards sustainable 
business models. Yet, extant literature on sustainable business models and sustainability-
oriented business model innovation (e.g. Schaltegger et al., 2016; Seelos and Mair, 2006; 
Yunus et al., 2010) has mainly focused on firms with a narrow business scope. It has instead 
overlooked the study of multibusiness companies, i.e. companies comprising multiple 
business units focused on specific products and/or customers (Martin and Eisenhardt, 2010). 
Due to their complexity, studying multibusiness firms is particularly relevant for a thorough 
understanding of organizational transitions to sustainability, as it allows to explore how 
different types of sustainable business models and heterogeneous dynamics of business 
model innovation for sustainability may coexist and interact within one organization.   
Multibusiness organizations often adopt a decentralized organizational structure, by 
“moving down the hierarchy the locus of authority and decision-making” (van Wijk et al. 
2008). Yet, scant attention has been given to investigating how a decentralized structure 
affects a firm’s sustainability transition. Our study aims to contribute to the understanding of 
business model innovation for sustainability, by exploring how a sustainability transition 
unfolds in a multibusiness, decentralized company.  
The study adopts inductive theory building (Eisenhardt, 1989) and uses a single 
embedded case study research design with multiple units of analysis. The selected case is a 
multibusiness company, comprising over 100 business units and having a decentralized 
organizational structure: the business units are independent, with their own profit and 
market responsibility. The data has been collected through semi-structured interviews with 
actors at different levels and with different responsibilities within the company.

Investigating the relationship between 
sustainability and business model innovation 
in the context of the European food industry

Abstract 
Organisations, and society at large, are nowadays facing enormous and unprecedented 
challenges in terms of sustainable development (United Nations General Assembly 2015). 
Therefore, there is an increasing necessity to prioritize sustainability concerns, and ensure 
the integration of sustainability into organisations’ business models. Such a prioritization and 
integration can in turn generate new opportunities to innovate and differentiate business 
models (Bocken et al. 2014), and, consequently, be decisive for organisations that want to 
sustain their competitiveness in the market (Teece 2010; Gambardella & McGahan 2010).  
Thus, on one hand, business model innovation can help to achieve significant 
improvements in terms of sustainability (Breuer and Lüdeke-Freund, 2017; Carayannis et al., 
2015; Pedersen et al., 2016; Rauter et al., 2017; Schaltegger et al., 2012). On the other, 
sustainability has the potential to inspire and drive business model innovation (Bocken et al., 
2014; Joyce and Paquin, 2016). As effectively explained by Ernesto Ciorra, Head of 
Innovation and Sustainability at Enel, “we are not sustainable unless we innovate, and in 
order to innovate, we have to be sustainable” (Global Reporting Initiative 2016).  
The current study aims to investigate the relationship between sustainability and 
business model innovation within the European food industry. Empirically, the analysis is 
based on survey data from 469 companies of seven European countries, namely Denmark, 
France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom. 
The overall results show that sustainability is slightly positively related to business 
model innovation. This seems to be particularly true for German companies, which show a 
high positive relationship. The result does not hold true for Danish companies, which show a 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
96 
slightly negative relationship. This study has implications for practitioners and scholars who 
work in the field of sustainability and business model innovation, especially in the context of 
the European food industry.

Micro-foundations of developing Sustainable 
Business Models

Sustainable Business Models, Micro-Foundations 
Abstract  
Firms increasingly seek to innovate or change business models in ways that integrate social 
and environmental concerns, developing what can be referred to as sustainable business 
models or business models for sustainability. Existing theory is divided in its view on the 
complexity of developing sustainable models; some contributions focus on a win-win 
perspective (where the firm can solve social and/or environmental problems and earn 
money at the same time) while other contributions look at sustainable business models from 
a complexity perspective. This latter literature argue that developing sustainable business 
models can be a complex matter that confronts managers with situations where they must 
simultaneously address multiple desirable but potentially conflicting outcomes that work at 
different levels (for the individual, firm and society). However, there is yet little empirical 
literature on the (micro) processes by which companies develop sustainable business models 
and on how sustainable business model innovation arises and is enacted in the organization.  
Sustainable business models imply a greater multiplicity of goals for firms to be able to 
satisfy the interests of various stakeholders, and addressing multiple goals is likely to raise 
the costs of decision making. Arguably, to succeed in developing sustainable business 
models, managers must be able to identify and mitigate areas of tensions and potential 
trade-offs between the social, environmental and financial goals of the business models. 
Such tensions are recognized as core characteristics of social enterprises; however literature 
provides no systematic analysis of how these tensions manifest.  
Research on the phenomenon of sustainable business models has an emphasis on 
concept understanding and conceptualizing as well as its implications for business model 
design and innovation. As of yet there has been little focus on the organizational and 
managerial implications of sustainable business models. And while there has been extensive 
research on the related concepts of corporate sustainability and corporate (social) 
responsibility, most of this has been based on a macro-oriented rather than micro-oriented 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
98 
approach. Research addressing the micro-foundations of corporate sustainability is emerging 
but in an early stage. There is now a growing literature that addresses the question of how 
managers interpret the ambiguous cues from their organizational context on sustainability 
issues from a cognitive perspective. However, research on corporate sustainability has been 
permeated by a strong focus on business case thinking which has resulted in the 
conceptualization 
of 
managerial 
responses 
to 
sustainability 
issues 
along 
an 
opportunity/threat dichotomy where the economic objectives of the firm dominate. 
Recently, there has been some research addressing corporate sustainability from a 
paradoxical perspective. Yet there is still little knowledge on issues such as how goals related 
to sustainability arise and are aggregated throughout the organization, how managers sense 
and shape opportunities for sustainable business models and the processes of how 
managers develop  sustainable business models.  
We intend to contribute to theory development by analyzing a case of developing 
sustainable business models within a large corporation. The research focuses on the 
Norwegian based telecommunication operator Telenor ASA, a group with considerable 
operations in emerging markets. Telenor is at present developing several digital business 
models with the potential of having high social impact on the societies where they are 
operating, and the corporation proclaims a shared value strategy for sustainability. We 
explore the development of Telenors business models to develop health services in 
Bangladesh, and the managerial challenges this invokes. Based on the case findings, we 
identify challenges and recommendations for how managers in practice may manage 
sustainable business models at different levels of the corporation.

Abstract 
A variety of business-related initiatives in recent decades have resulted in innovations aimed 
at driving and responding to society’s sustainability demands. Among these, business models 
are increasingly recognised as having an important role to play. Sustainability-oriented 
business models are envisaged and operationalised as a part of corporate strategies to 
address sustainability issues along supply chains, whether regional or international. The 
outcomes of such models (described variously as ‘sustainable’, ‘circular’, ‘resource-efficient’, 
‘novel’ or ‘alternative’) depend on the underlying normative principles guiding society’s 
sustainability demands. In order to assess how successful they are in responding to these 
demands, it is necessary to develop indicators that measure the actual performance of these 
business models. The intricately complex value proposition of business models makes this 
problematic and, despite growing theoretical literature on business model innovations in 
recent years, there is still a lack of key indicators and tools to measure to what extent such 
innovations could contribute to sustainable development. In their absence, it is difficult to 
assess and control the short- and long-term outcomes of innovations, both within and across 
organisations. The development of such indicators, tools and frameworks could not only 
assist organisations towards better-planned innovations, but make explicit some of the 
factors - internal as well as external to the organisation - influencing their implementation 
and operation.  
The present study is an attempt to address this research gap by reviewing practical 
examples of a range of sustainability-oriented business models. Business models were 
analysed focusing on (i) prolonging product lifetimes; (ii) facilitating systems for product 
reuse, repair, remanufacturing and end-of-life product collection; (iii) offering product 
warranties; (iv) providing contracts for supplying spare parts and/or upgrading the product’s 

 
NBM@Graz2017

functionality; and (vi) offering collaborative consumption. A variety of products and services 
were addressed, including vehicles, transport, building materials, household appliances and 
tools, consumer electronics, textiles and industrial equipment. Although these business 
models contribute to a range of social, economic and environmental impacts, both positive 
and negative, the present study focuses on their impact on reducing the overall demand of 
materials and energy. A life cycle perspective including product design, production, retailing 
and distribution, consumption and post-consumer discard was utilised in order to identify 
major gaps within these business models in a global perspective. Data was collected for 
more than 600 products and associated services through journal papers, websites and 
reports.  
The study shows that many sustainability-oriented innovations, within both semi-
durable and durable product sectors, claim to adopt an approach based on longer lasting 
product design or some other aspect of sustainable design; however, there is still a lack of 
focus on providing an effective system for managing discarded products. On the other hand, 
due to advances in information technology, collaborative consumption has recently grown 
for transport, and power tools and equipment. Within the product categories studied a 
range of novel products and services, with a large potential to reduce the overall demand for 
materials and energy, was identified; however, their market share is currently very small, in 
particular due to high prices, especially for semi-durable products such as clothing and 
durable products such as furniture, flooring and household appliances. A novel business 
model to deliver maximum material and energy efficiency within each product category was 
proposed and discussed.

How can B Corps build effective partnerships 
to scale up their social impacts for a 
sustainable society?

Abstract 
Entrepreneurship and innovation play an important role in moving to a more sustainable 
society (Schaltegger and Wagner, 2011). Sustainability-driven entrepreneurs not only create 
products and services that are successful in the marketplace, but also integrate social and 
environmental goals into the core of their business. Certain sustainable entrepreneurs 
contribute to solving social and environmental problems while simultaneously seeking to 
generate a profit-oriented business model. These “hybrid” organizations seek to “transform 
the market structure intentionally and directly by creating economic, social, and/or 
environmental value simultaneously” (McMullen and Warnick, in press, p. 12).  
‘B Corps’ – for-profit, socially obligated, corporate forms of business, with traditional 
corporate characteristics but also with societal commitments (Hiller, 2013) – are a new form 
of sustainable entrepreneurship business model. To become a B Corp, a business must 
complete an Impact Assessment, which assesses the overall impact of the company on its 
stakeholders and be assessed by the certification body B Lab. To be certified, the business 
must earn a minimum 80 points out of a possible 200 points in the assessment. The B Corp 
vision is: “people using business as a force for good” in order that all companies “compete 
not just to be the best in the world, but to be the best for the world” (B Lab, 2014, emphasis 
in original). 
The purpose of this paper is to report on preliminary findings of an empirical study that 
sought to understand how B Corps across three countries (Australia, Chile and USA) develop 
relationships to drive their social impacts. An exploratory research design was crafted to 
address the central research question ‘how can B Corps form and maintain effective 
partnerships and networks for a more sustainable society?’ We adopted a relational 
approach to explore the type and purpose of the relationships B Corps had with their key 
stakeholders and to determine if and how they sought to influence these relationships to 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
103 
obtain purposeful outcomes. B Corps were sampled through the publicly available B Lab and 
Sistema B databases. Complexity of stakeholder relationships was assumed to be associated 
with longer duration of certification, higher certification score and industry type. B Lab staff 
were consulted to confirm selected B Corps were most likely to be characterized by more 
complex stakeholder relationships.  
Research participants were founders or senior managers of the sampled B Corps who 
responded favorably to an interview. A total of 18 participants, each representing a different 
B Corp, completed the interview. Semi-structured interview questions were designed to 
explore the formative and relational aspects of partnerships and stakeholder interactions 
and to identify challenges encountered when building partnerships with like-minded for-
profit, for-purpose businesses (interview questions can be found in attachment A). 
Participants were asked to discuss the approach they took when developing different types 
of business relationships while seeking to obtain their purpose. Such purpose was not 
defined singularly, yet each participant articulated an ambition for societal change. 
Interviews ranged between thirty minutes to one hour. They were transcribed in full and 
analyzed using NVivo 11 adopting a grounded approach. Firstly the interview text was coded 
line-by-line to generate codes. A coding summary was created and discussed between three 
members of the research team to validate key concepts. Following this a second round of 
coding occurred to ensure emergent concepts codes could be back coded against all 
interviews. Concepts were then organized into three main thematic clusters: motivation for 
becoming a B Corp; characteristics of relationships with other stakeholders; and, the type 
and purpose of relationships with various stakeholders (including other B Corps, B Labs, 
customers, other large organisations, other organisations and suppliers).  Within each of 
these thematic clusters, concept nodes were further categorized to clarify key concepts 
within each theme. For the purposes of analyzing the research question for this paper, we 
provide an overview of the key concepts related to the characteristics of relationships and 
partnerships themes to address our research question regarding how and why B Corps form 
partnerships with other stakeholders to achieve their purpose-driven mission.  
Preliminary analysis revealed four concepts that participants discussed when describing 
the various different types of relationships. In order of most prominent these were 
‘Influence partners’, ‘Partner intentionally’, ‘Obstacles’ and ‘Partnering organically’.  
The most prominent concept was ‘Influence partners’ which related to how B Corps 
sought to influence partners to ensure alignment of values. This concept contained fours 
sub-concepts that characterized how influence was sought as either being through 
establishing credibility, advocating for-purpose, requiring certification as the basis for 
partnering, or less formally seeking to convey purpose through informal conversations. 
Predominantly this came either through the credibility they obtained through the 
certification or through advocating their purpose. Credibility through the B Corp certification 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
104 
was the predominate sub-concept for influencing partnerships. This was particularly relevant 
for suppliers, but less important for customers where B Corp there was less brand 
recognition in relation to consumption decisions. The certification enabled B Corps to 
explain what they do/their purpose. This was not necessarily seen as a means of attracting 
clients, but rather for better articulating to them what they do as the following quote 
illustrates:  
‘And it’s a good frame for us saying – well, first of all, people say, “What 
does the name mean, it’s a weird name?” And then we explain that and just 
say they’re the ways in which we make sure that we’re staying true to that, 
which tends to be received very well, generally’.  
The second most significant sub-concept was how B Corps sought to advocate their 
values and the benefits of being a B Corp to their partners. This was especially prevalent in 
the procurement of sustainable materials, when providing services to corporate clients and 
when connecting with customers who had limited awareness of sustainability issues. The 
following queotes is illustrateive: 
‘So we have advocated to each of our key partners for them to become B 
Corps, with varying levels of success….. we wouldn’t work with anyone who 
doesn’t resonate with, and we’ve done our best to try to convert them’.  
The third most prominent sub-concept was ‘informal conversation’. Four BCorps 
described how they sought to influence their partners more informally through 
conversations as one stated ‘we do talk to them about it but we don’t yet put in writing’. The 
final sub-concept occurred in two examples, where BCorps sought more direct forms of 
influence whereby they make voluntary certification a pre-condition for developing 
partnerships. This form of influence only applied in relationships with suppliers or clients, for 
example: 
‘As an investor, we have a lot more influence on potential partners, because 
people…..want the investment, they want the money and therefore when 
we say to them in order to work with us you need to do a B Corp 
certification, and you need to at least do the impact assessment and tell us 
what your score is’. 
 
The second most prominent concept was ‘intentional or purposeful’, which 
characterized how B Corps sought partnerships with an intention or specific criteria in mind. 
Participants sought the ‘right opportunities’ by selecting partner relationships that ‘fit their 
purpose’. Participants discussed how relationships were purposefully or intentionally 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
105 
established to ensure they did not compromise their B Corp values. Thus they pursued 
relationships with other B Corps wherever possible, or sought an alignment of values with 
other non-B Corp organisations. As the following indicates: 
“We’ll only work with companies that are aligned, from a values point of 
view. And the top of that group are the B Corps, and then there’ll also be 
businesses that are not B Corps, but could be, according to other 
certifications that they might have or the relationships that we’ve 
developed with them and we know the way they work and operate in the 
world”.  
 
The other two concepts associated with this category were of less prominence. 
‘Barriers’ where, five BCorps discussed how they encountered barriers in their partnership 
relationships due to being small scale, an absence of values alignment or a lack of senior 
buy-in, time and resources or misunderstanding. Finally, ‘organically’ where two B Corps 
discussed how their partnerships were developed more organically as the following quote 
illustrates: 
‘I think just by doing your thing and standing up for what you do, I think 
people just gravitate towards that anyway’ and ‘I think, those things just 
naturally come out of conversation at events like that, and we’ve found 
that's the way it’s happened’. 
 
Finally, we analyzed how B Corps describe the utility of various different types of 
stakeholder relationships. This analysis reveals different category types of relationships that 
occurred across the variety of different stakeholder relationships. These categories are 
conceptualized as a spectrum ranging from ‘transactional’ through to ‘symbolic 
interconnection’, with the former being described primarily a form of exchange and the  
latter being typified as a relationship motivated for enabling some form of social or 
environmentally-oriented change. Unpacking each of these categories we found variation in 
the categories as they were ascribed to different stakeholders. Taking the ‘symbolic 
interconnection’ example, while some B Corps described their relationships with other B 
Corps and B Lab as identifying with a broader group of like-minded businesses, not all 
subscribed to the same conceptualization of what that group represents. Some clearly 
described this as a sense of belonging to a broader ‘tribe’, community or movement, while 
others described it more loosely as a network or in functional terms as a hub for connecting 
with like-minded others. Such findings will be discussed in further detail in the presentation 
of this paper.  

 
NBM@Graz2017

Taken together these preliminary findings suggest B Corps operate beyond their 
immediate business model to create and establish relationships in their operating 
environment that will enable sustainable development outcomes.

Abstract 
Current business models do not provide sustainable solutions for future generations (Jonker, 
2014). Authors like Jan Jonker and Porter and Kramer are presenting new business models, 
which might provide solutions (Jonker, 2014; Kramer &Porter 2011). By observing these 
models, we came to the conclusion that the application of those models lead to social 
exclusion and the affected group of persons are not involved within the decision making 
process (Pennink, 2016). From our perspective it is therefore important to look for projects 
or organizations, which include social excluded persons within the society so that we can 
therefore create together a more sustainable world.  
Parkin (2006) argues that social exclusion can be described as a withdrawal from the 
society in order to accomplish a beneficial position. By achieving a privileged position other 
groups experience losses within their welfare through the process of subordination (Parkin, 
2006).  Social exclusion and social relationships, which are limited when people got excluded 
from certain activities or communities, were recently more discussed under the social capital 
theory (Bowen, 2009; Gingrich, 2008). “Whereas economic capital is in the people’s bank 
accounts and human capital is in inside their heads, social capital inheres in the structure of 
their relationship” (Portes, 1998, p.7). Therefore we were looking for a catalyst, which can 
provide social inclusion and community building for future business models.   
The European Commission describes social inclusion as “a process which ensures that 
those at risk of poverty and social exclusion gain the opportunities and resources necessary 
to participate fully in economic, social and cultural life, and to enjoy a standard of living and 
well – being that is considered normal in the society in which they live. It ensures that they 
have greater participation in decision – making, which affects their lives and access to 
fundamental rights (European Commission, 2004 p.8). 
In our opinion several social entrepreneurs provide interesting attempts of community 
building and provide help to social excluded persons.

According to Zahra: “Social entrepreneurs make significant and diverse contributions on 
their own communities and societies, adopting business models to offer creative solutions to 
complex and persistent social problems” (Zahra et al. 2009). This idea builds up with the 
opinion of Wallace, who believes that social entrepreneurship has the intention to create 
sustainable projects or activities to reduce community issues (Wallace, 1999).  Nevertheless, 
even if social entrepreneurs implement creative solutions to address complex social 
problems, they also use traditional business and market-orientated models (Spear, 2006; 
Dorado, 2006). The article of Ferreira “conceptualizing social entrepreneurship: perspectives 
from the literature” highlights additionally that there is no clear distinction within the 
definition of social entrepreneurship and “normal or traditional” entrepreneurship because 
entrepreneurship also addresses social problems (Ferreira et al., 2016). In terms of definition 
we want to use Austin’s definition of a social entrepreneur within the extend of this paper: 
“We define social entrepreneurship as innovative, social value creating activity that can 
occur within or across the nonprofit, business or government sectors”. (Austin et al., 2006 
p.2). We therefore came up with the research question: 
 “What can we learn from social entrepreneurs and their community building aspect for 
future business models?” 
Unlike common research practices this paper tries to turn the business modeling 
development from literature into building the models from practices (Schultz, 2005). We use 
a qualitative case study approach to better understand in which way social entrepreneurs 
act as a catalyst for community building while creating different kind of values. A qualitative 
analysis gives better opportunities to analyze complex phenomenon’s where scholars lack 
knowledge in (Corbin & Strauss, 2008). We follow Jan Jonkers methods approach, who 
conducted in depth-interviews and let participants draw their business model/ business idea 
(Jonker, 2014). For the data analysis we use the grounded theory, which means interviews 
get conducted and recorded so that the authors can listen to the interviews again with the 
intension to find similarities or contradictions within the data set (Mills, 2013). Limited to 
the financial extend of a master thesis and the short period of time doing the research, the 
authors could manage to find and speak to social entrepreneurs within the countries 
Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Canada. Most of the samples were found online by 
looking for social projects or social entrepreneurs in Google. It was important to the authors 
to find projects and organizations within different fields of their action to conduct general 
knowledge about business concepts of social entrepreneurs. 
We believe that this research can contribute to a business model transformation 
discussion in a way of learning from social entrepreneurs in terms of social inclusion.

Sustainable entrepreneurship, responsible 
innovation, and new business models: 
 how responsible innovations can attract the 
necessary finance

Introduction  
Sustainable entrepreneurs develop innovations that are needed to tackle the grand 
challenges faced by society, such as sustainable development. These innovations often take 
the form of New Business Models (NBMs), which are developed by combining different 
products, services, and activities, to form new value propositions (Jonker, 2016). Sustainable 
entrepreneurs make societal contributions by combining commercial and sustainable (i.e. 
non-commercial) objectives and values (often at the cost of economic outcomes). In this 
way, the development of NBMs can be considered a type of responsible innovation. 
Responsible innovation is an approach to innovation focused on producing the ‘right 
impacts’ and contributing to ‘grand challenges’ (Owen et al., 2012; von Schomberg, 2013), in 
a way that includes the dimensions of anticipation, inclusivity, reflexiveness and 
responsiveness (Stilgoe et al., 2013).  
NBMs that contribute to the solving of grand challenges can often raise socio-ethical 
issues. This can be due to the innovations they involve (i.e. new technologies, for example, 
the internet of things and big data), or because they often incorporate a wider array of 
stakeholder demands. This means that sustainable entrepreneurs have to manage a range of 
different socio-ethical issues in a responsible way in order for NBMs to succeed.  
Socio-ethical issues and their management can create problems when it comes to 
obtaining investment and finance. While sustainable entrepreneurs may themselves be 
willing and able to manage socio-ethical issues, investors may not have an interest nor 
motivation to integrate socio-ethical factors in the NBM design (Dumas and Louche, 2016). 

 
NBM@Graz2017

From the investor perspective, responsibility could be seen as an unwanted side-effect and 
not critical to their objectives – to obtain a return on investment (ROI). The problem of 
investor involvement is due to assumptions, based on traditional economic theory, as well as 
more recent research on Socially Responsible Investment (SRI), that investors are profit 
maximizers, unwilling to compromise their ROI (Pasewark and Riley, 2010; von Wallis and 
Klein, 2015). This is pertinent as NBMs may produce lower financial ROI, creating tensions 
that can limit the achievement of non-commercial objectives (Harris et al., 2009).  
In such circumstances, changing the business model design and how socio-ethical 
factors are incorporated into innovation and entrepreneurial processes could help overcome 
these challenges. Incorporating socio-ethical issues into the business model design in 
particular ways, for example in terms of the value proposition (for instance, through 
enhanced animal welfare standards or green consumer products), could provide added 
value, and strengthen the investment case. However, such an approach may not be suitable 
for all types of investment, as investors are not a homogenous group. Different investors, 
such venture capitalists, investment banks or crowdsourcing organizations, are likely to have 
different requirements or needs in relation to investing in these responsible innovations 
(Sievänen et al., 2013). While impact or responsible investors may be well suited to assess 
responsible investments (in terms of valuing nonfinancial issues) and provide finance, more 
traditional retail investors, asset managers or institutional investors may not. The 
explanations for why investors finance sustainable entrepreneurship are also diverse, 
including the ‘warm glow’ they personally received from an ethical choice (Andreoni, 1990) 
or as a response to consumer demands (Dam and Scholtens, 2015). 
Methods and approach  
In this research, we seek to explore the conditions that are required for sustainable 
entrepreneurs to obtain investments for their responsible innovation NBMs. These 
conditions include the mentality and motivations of different types of investors, as well as 
how socio-ethical issues are incorporated into business models and investment logics.  
By exploring these factors, we will gain an understanding of how best to embed social 
ethical issues into NBMs so that they do not limit the opportunity to obtain investment, and 
even potentially enhance the investment case. We further aim to explore whether 
classification is possible according to the type of NBM and/or type of investor. In doing so, 
we answer the research question:  
 How can business model design, in terms of the incorporation of socio-ethical 
factors, help overcome barriers and enhance drivers for investment within contexts 
of sustainable entrepreneurship?

The research takes place in the context of European clean tech start-ups within the 
agricultural, water and energy sectors. An inductive qualitative approach is adopted, utilizing 
an initial focus group session with investors, followed by case studies. This is an appropriate 
approach, as the research problem is complex, requiring a broad holistic understanding, 
where many potential variables exist, while our questions are seeking to explore ‘how’ and 
‘why’ aspects (Creswell, 2012; Leedy and Ormrod, 2005).  
The focus group will provide an initial understanding of the perceptions, mentalities, 
and attitudes of a range of different types of investors, towards investing in responsible 
innovations and how business model design can impact the investment case (Greenbaum, 
1998). Participants include key individuals from investment banks, crowdsourcing 
organizations, regional development banks, venture capitalists as well as individual investors 
such as business angels. Following this, more in-depth data is collected via semi-structured 
interviews across case studies. Each case includes a sustainable entrepreneur with their 
corresponding investors – in this way, we can shed light on both sides of the relationship and 
understand key dynamics. The cases will examine the NBMs associated with clean-tech 
innovations within the contexts of agriculture, water, and energy within the Netherlands.  
Expected results and conclusions  
The results will contribute to the literature on NBMs, sustainable entrepreneurship and 
responsible investment by highlighting the critical success factors and necessary conditions 
needed for responsible innovations to obtain investment and finance. This will include 
highlighting which investment sources may be most aligned with a responsible innovation 
approach, and how new financial models and revenue logics can enhance the responsibility 
outcomes of NBMs.

Universities’ central role as incubator in 
social entrepreneurial ecosystems

Abstract 
Collaborative online platforms in support of social entrepreneurs have not yet been 
discussed as a tool of universities in their role as incubators within the entrepreneurial 
ecosystem. Entrepreneurship, as the driving force of socio-economic development, receives 
quite a lot of attention from universities, both from a knowledge and technology point of 
view. Furthermore, social entrepreneurship, where the main entrepreneurial goal is a social 
instead of an economic objective, is also gaining attention among higher education 
institutions. Supportive online platforms for social entrepreneurs can be considered as a 
specific case in which such a collaborative tool could be of further use to overcome both 
launching and scaling challenges social entrepreneurs encounter, among many other issues. 
Universities play an important central role in the development of social entrepreneurial 
ecosystems and start-ups. This has lead us to the following research question: How can 
universities support social entrepreneurial start-ups towards a more successful launch of 
their project? Using several projects launched on the collaborative platform for social 
entrepreneurship, set up by the Chair on Social Entrepreneurship at the Vrije Universiteit of 
Brussels, we will perform a longitudinal study on several social entrepreneurial start up cases 
over the next three years, denoting the use and efficiency of such a nurturing platform. 
Introduction 
Universities are seen as one of the most important and efficient mechanism to create value 
to society and regional economic development (Belitski & Heron, 2017). Due to their 
innovative role towards society, we can consider both their centrality for entrepreneurial 
development and opportunities, as well as the direct reach they have throughout several 
entities and organizations. Indeed, as a centre of knowledge as well as a central figure to 
several types of stakeholders within society, a university has a direct socio-economic impact 
on both business and society as a whole (Etzkowitz, Webster, Gebhardt, Regina, & Terra, 
2000). Universities, next to their educating role, are becoming more aware on their need to 
stimulate and nurture the required innovation and support of start-ups for economic 
development. 

 
NBM@Graz2017

This direct socio-economic impact is generated throughout several initiatives; one of 
those include the growing number of university ventures (Åstebro, Bazzazian, & Braguinsky, 
2012). Also known as spinoffs, these have amongst other characteristics, a positive effect on 
the local economic development (Vincett, 2010). Given university’s unique position between 
business and society, it plays an important role for the internal dynamics of a sustainable 
business ecosystem (Schaeffer & Matt, 2016). Indeed, as an inhibitor for example, it can 
trigger the densification of the ecosystem, consisting of, amongst others, entrepreneurs, 
firms and investors (Etzkowitz, 2008). 
This statement holds also certainly true when it comes to social entrepreneurship, a 
specific form of entrepreneurship, which focuses on addressing social problems whilst 
keeping a commercial mind-set to it (Austin, Stevenson, & Wei-Skillern, 2006). Social 
entrepreneurs, as the central actors in the social entrepreneurship phenomena, come up 
with innovative and sustainable solutions to urgent social matters. Combining the mind-set 
of a for-profit economic need as well as the not-for-profit charity goal, they seek to 
overcome our most challenging social issues in a sustainable way (Mair & Martí, 2006; Smith, 
Gonin, & Besharov, 2013; Zahra, Gedajlovic, Neubaum, & Shulman, 2009). 
Several well-respected universities have already implemented strategic actions aimed at 
establishing a link between academia and social entrepreneurs. Courses and research on 
social entrepreneurship - as well as events, publications and permanent support to students 
and alumni fascinated by the idea of beginning their social ventures - are among the actions 
the university undertakes to support social entrepreneurs. 
Regarding the latter, the Chair on Social Entrepreneurship at the Vrije Universiteit 
Brussel (2017) is creating a multidisciplinary online crowdfunding and -sourcing platform in 
support of social entrepreneurs. The main idea is that this networking platform gives the 
opportunity to create and share a social entrepreneurial project, which provides the 
possibility to social entrepreneurs to not only receive financial and non-financial resources, 
but also the proper coaching and experience from both academics and seasoned 
practitioners in the field. This collaborative platform mixes young social entrepreneurial 
minded students from the VUB, transforming their ideas into action, with those who wish to 
support them. 
Currently, the online platform is scheduled to be launched by end of March 2017, having 
already 4 pilot cases ready to be launched. The current cases regard several social aspects. 
One case named F.LY. seeks to empower women through personalized clothing. Another 
case is a platform for second hand textbooks for VUB-students, giving “unused” textbooks a 
second life for a fair price. A third case considers co-housing between elderly and young 
people and the fourth case considers social driven quests with a social application, “changing 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
116 
the world, one good deed at the time”. It is the Chair’s ambition to up this number of cases 
to two dozens of cases per year. 
The platform can be considered as an innovative tool that could alleviate several 
challenges social entrepreneur encounter on its scaling process both at the incubating and 
start- up phase. It is our aim to help the social entrepreneurs with, amongst other things, to 
set up a healthy double bottom line (Moss, Short, Payne, & Lumpkin, 2011; Pache & Andre, 
2016; Smith et al., 2013), creating the correct social and financial performance measurements 
(Austin et al., 2006; Grimes, 2010; Haski-Leventhal & Mehra, 2016), while nurturing their 
entrepreneurial and management skills (Hemingway, 2005; Weber, Kröger, & Lambrich, 2012; 
Wronka, 2013; Zahra et al., 2009).

Towards New Business Models – On Push 
and Pull (F)Actors of Social Entrepreneurship 
and Value Contribution

Abstract 
Our world as we know it currently finds itself in a system crisis urging us to rethink our 
economic system and the way we produce, consume, spill and devastate (Rotmans and 
Horsten, 2012). This urge becomes apparent through, for instance, the large economic 
difference between North and South, climate change and the recent financial crisis. In order 
to accurately address such challenges, a fundamental systems change is needed to reform 
our economy at the individual as well as organisational and societal level (Rauter et al., 
2017). In doing so, merely focusing on efficiency and optimization is not sufficient. Our 
current economic ideas are unsustainable, outdated and require a reorganisation of our 
current business models towards new business models (NBMs) that put sustainability at the 
centre of attention (Jonker, 2012). 
Our economy is undergoing a transition, in which the benefits of the traditional system 
clash with the ambition of the future, hence the system crisis. Traditional firms often find it 
challenging to adjust their existing methods, partly since they are often still judged using 
financial measures such as ROI. While this is difficult for existing businesses, NBM 
development allows for a great level of entrepreneurial creativity (Jonker, 2012). It thrives 
by initiatives set up by and for social entrepreneurs (SEs) to improve the quality of their 
(local) environment and the people living in it. SEs pursue multiple value creation, which 
entails that entrepreneurial activity is carried out not merely for the sake of creating 
economic value, but rather to create ecological and social values (Jonker, 2012; Wieland, 
2017). 
A substantial amount of scientific research has explored the phenomenon of social 
entrepreneurship (e.g. Austin et al., 2006; Cohen and Winn, 2007; Pacheco et al., 2010; 
Zahra et al., 2013). However, there remain considerable uncertainties regarding the 
motivational values of SEs (e.g. Yitshaki & Kropp, 2016). Also, previous research is mostly 
descriptive, based on case studies, lacking prescriptive power. In this paper we study the 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
119 
contribution of SEs to the systems change needed. We do so by investigating the push and 
pull factors either stimulating SEs to or keeping them from creating social and ecological 
value on an increasing scale. First, we identify SEs’ internal motivation to scale up their value 
creation, structured according to the human motivational value structure by Schwartz 
(1994). Next, the external factors that currently enable or hinder SEs from increasing their 
value creation are presented. Within the incentives as well as external factors, emphasis is 
placed on the different actors involved (e.g. communities, governments) inspired by the 
multi-actor, multi-value matrix by Pennink (2016). This deepens not just our understanding 
of the motivational values of SEs, but also of the actors that are involved by pulling SEs 
towards, or pushing them away from, growing their social and ecological value creation by 
applying larger-scale business models.  
Where previous research on SEs mainly targets individual entrepreneurs, this thesis 
gathers data by conducting semi-structured interviews with NGOs specialized in supporting 
social entrepreneurs, as these are considered a rich source of entrepreneurial experience. 
Among the NGOs is Ideas in Motion, a German-based NGO supporting entrepreneurs in 
Rwanda. Other interviews are conducted with American and European NGOs, among which 
the Netherlands-based offices of Ashoka and Both ENDS.  
Ultimately, SEs pursue a high level of social and/or ecological value with their 
businesses. They often aim to not just be a ‘drop in the ocean’, but to realize a truly large 
positive impact. By identifying the push and pull factors for growing SEs’ businesses, on a 
multi-value, multi-actor level, i.e. knowing what and who stimulates or keeps SEs from 
growing their sustainable social and ecological value creation, new insights are gained that 
are beneficial for academics and practitioners working on the development of NBMs.

How to facilitate social entrepreneurship for 
developing circular economy into territories? 
Feedbacks from systemic design 
methodology applied to the Nouvelle 
Aquitaine Region  
Marion Real*, Iban Lizarralde 
ESTIA – RECHERCHE, Technopole Izarbel, 64210 Bidart

Introduction 
The shift toward a circular economy is initiated at different scales by a strong diversity of 
stakeholders (policy makers, industrials, designers, citizens…), approaches (eco-design, 
industrial and territorial ecology, cradle-to-cradle, systemic design…) and participate to the 
emergence of new business models (sustainable product-services systems, makerspaces and 
repair café, resource-based local networks…). The proximity between circular economy and 
a recent archetype of sustainable business model (Bocken, 2014), the “social enterprise” is 
high and the processes of social innovation (Ceschin, 2014) and entrepreneurship 
(Verstraete, 2010) are gaining interest to be studied in both meso and micro levels. 
Social enterprises have heterogeneous forms and status (cooperatives, associations, 
unions, SMEs…). Their business models could be defined by 4 criterions (Le Mouves, 2013): 
(1) the creation of an economic or entrepreneurial project, (2) a social or societal purpose, 
(3) No or limited lucrativeness (profits reinvested in the project, limited remuneration of 
capital, and a supervised wage scale) and (4) a democratic or participatory governance. 
Social entrepreneurs are perceived as catalyzers of change (FAIVRE, 2010). As any 
innovators, they navigate in complex environments and are facing numerous difficulties all 
along the life-cycle of the project and the evolution of their organizations. European 
commission are encouraging actions to improve the visibility, the access to funding, the legal 
environment and the international expansion of social enterprises (EU, 2016). 
In this paper, we explore how social entrepreneurship could become a key component 
to foster circular economy into territories and discuss about the support that could offer 
regional intermediary structures (Howell, 2006)(Agogue, 2012) like public institutions, 
agencies, incubators, schools….

Methodology 
Our findings are based on a current action-research coming from the Interreg Europe project 
entitled RETRACE (interregeurope.eu/retrace/), which aims to promote circular economy 
into five regions through a systemic design methodology. Systemic design regards the study 
of industrial and agricultural processes as complex networks that transform the output of a 
process in a chain mechanism whose goal is the total elimination of manufacturing waste 
(Bistagnino, 2010). At regional level, the methodology of the project consists in different 
steps:  
 A holistic diagnosis is framing the metabolism of regions through different 
dimensions (politics, geographics, urban centers, cultures, flow resources, economics 
and good practices) so as to identify potentialities and critical issues in different 
sectors.  
 Then, regional and local stakeholders are participating in the co-design of regional 
policies for circular economy within a systemic vision that will be analyzed and 
implemented.  
The Nouvelle Aquitaine is one of the region involved in the project and is the main focus 
of our analysis. The participation of the researchers in this ongoing project allowing to both 
capture the actual structure of social economy in Nouvelle Aquitaine but also to impulse 
new policies, rules and type of supports in direct relation with circular economy. Currently, 
our research material consists in: 
 An analysis of actual political instruments for social and circular economy in Nouvelle 
Aquitaine that we realized in the holistic diagnosis of the Retrace project.  
  The business models for 15 social enterprises plus 3 intermediary supporting 
organizations were observed thanks to the interviews with project owners and to the 
regional platform RECITA. 
 Three stakeholder meetings aimed to respectively framing the actual lacks of 
supports for circular initiatives, transferring knowledge through good practices and 
sharing around three sectors (agriculture, wood and textile). The stakeholder 
meetings were co-designed and organized by the authors of the paper with 
industrials, social entrepreneurs, policy makers, and NGOs.  
Key findings 
Two kinds of feedbacks are highlighted by this action research. They concern (1) the process 
of social entrepreneurship and (2) the role of regions in supporting it.

(1)   Social entrepreneurs are overwhelmed by dialogisms (Morin, 2007) (Real, 2015): 
they face individual and collective decisions (Todres, 2016) through horizontal or 
vertical management for both short and long term visions and share the double 
objective of job creation and ecosystem healthcare. 
It exists two different logics for such business models: the traditional social 
organizations offer social jobs and training for people in difficulty. They depend on 
public funds and are built around a strong turn over. A new wave is emerging 
through the empowerment of citizens and other stakeholders which experiment new 
forms of participation (cooperatives of citizens, producers or consumers, holacracy 
management, sharing platforms…) and dare taking responsibility or investing time 
and money to collectively answer to social & environmental needs. Most of 
emergent successful business models are hybrids and combine both market 
revenues, subventions and member fees.  
 
(2) Within the actual political context, regions remain central stakeholders to make 
visible the needs for the territory and develop local circular economy. In France, the 
perimeter of social economy need to be redesigned so as to shape to territorial 
potentialities and criticalities. Regions need to offer a structural and coherent plan 
for both inspiring and supporting social and circular initiatives in a more transparent 
and participative way. 
Guided by territorial resource-flow evolutions and by a frequent elicitation of 
stakeholder needs and uses, regions are up to design adapted tools (platform, maps, 
directory), supports (R&D, equipment, investment) and collaboration mechanisms 
with local stakeholders (agency, schools, incubators, NgO…) for facilitating the 
development of social entrepreneurship for grassroots initiatives as well as top-down 
innovations.

Introduction and purpose  
The relevance of Business model innovation (BMI) to survival and competitiveness of 
companies is largely acknowledged by academia and industry. Still, a recent study by 
Bouwman et al (2016) showed that 37% of Europe’s small and medium sized companies 
(SMEs) are engaged in BM Innovation. This means that almost two thirds of the SMEs do not 
change their business logic, thus staying within their familiar comfort zone. This can be fine 
for some, but many more SMEs will need to adjust and innovate their business model as the 
world changes around them especially due to digitalisation. Moreover, very few SMEs use 
formal methods to improve their BM - of those SMEs that do BM Innovation, only 19% make 
use of formal methods (Bouwman et al., 2016). This raises a question whether it is possible 
to support the BM innovation of SMEs by providing them tools that fit their strategic aims 
and practical BMI needs.  
In this paper, we present two design cycles for an online platform with ICT-enabled 
tooling that supports business model innovation by SMEs. The platform connects the needs 
of the SMEs regarding BMI with tools that can help to solve those needs and questions. The 
needs are derived from our earlier case study work (Heikkilä et al. 2016), showing typical 
BMI patterns of the SMEs needs - labelled as ‘I want to’s - about what an entrepreneur 
wants to achieve with business model innovation. The platform provides sets of integrated 
tools that can answer the typical ‘I want to’ questions that SMEs have with innovating their 
business models. 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
127 
Method 
We follow the approach described by Verschuren and Hartog (2005) for design-oriented 
research. We derived requirements from interviews with SMEs and SME helpers, brainstorm 
sessions, literature on existing tooling, the partners’ experience with tooling in practice and 
earlier research results and intermediate evaluation (De Reuver at al., 2016; Heikkilä et al., 
2016). 
Results 
The platform is a first that provides BMI tooling specifically for SMEs. We adapt 29 BMI tools 
for the specific needs of SMEs, including `paths’ that integrate multiple tools for reaching a 
particular `I want to’ goal (Table 1). The platform has been implemented through a 
prototype, see Figure 1 for the homepage and Figure 2 for the business model innovation 
paths. Evaluation is ongoing using log data from the platform and action research case 
studies in which the tools and platform will be applied by actual SMEs in real-life innovation 
projects. In May 2017, we have about 2,000 sessions by almost 1,000 users, with an average 
number of 6.4 page views.

Increased availability and fast diffusion of new technologies opens up new opportunities for 
product and service offerings and inherently changes customer and partner relationships 
(Kiel, 2016 referring to (Kagermann, 2013)). Technological changes can disrupt entire 
industries and require changes of used key technologies (e.g. shift from analog to digital 
photography) for products as well as new ways of value offerings (e.g. shift from product to 
more service oriented business models – hybrid business models (Ehrenhöfer, Kreuzer, 
Aschbacher, & Pusterhofer, 2013)). Technological progress is one of the needs requiring 
“managers to significantly adapt one or more aspects of their business models” (Wirtz, 
Schilke, & Ullrich, 2010, S. 273) or even design completely new ones. Business models need 
to be constantly monitored and revised to meet the ultimate goal of business model 
innovation (BMI), namely the creation of long-term competitive advantage (Wirtz, Schilke, & 
Ullrich, 2010). Various frameworks have been developed to guide business model innovation 
(BMI) with focus on start-ups as well as established companies e.g. (Breuer, 2013), 
(Osterwalder & Pigneur, 2010). 
The purpose of this research is to gain insights into how digitalization impacts business 
models. In this context, BMI is understood as the change of certain elements of a business 
model or even the introduction of a completely new business model due to increased 
digitalization. First results of the explorative phase of our study, consisting of expert 
interviews will be presented. In total seven interviews were conducted with Austrian experts 
from media as well as manufacturing industry. Aspects such as the relevance of digital 
technologies for the business model of the experts’ company in the past as well as in future 
were discussed. Furthermore, effects of digitalization on the business model in general and 
especially on value creation, value proposition and value capture were elaborated.

All in all, this study should improve the understanding of how digitalization influences 
business model innovation. Particularly it is about (1) a better understanding of specifics of 
digitalization within particular branches; (2) exploring the ways how companies change their 
business models with regard to digitalization; and (3) to derive insights and 
recommendations which can be of help for practitioners in other industries as well.

Crypto Currency and Hybrid Banking: 
Exploring community-based business models 
enabling multi-value transactions fostering 
sustainability

Extended abstract 
This conceptual paper explores how contemporary crypto-transaction technology can be 
used to foster material and social sustainability. Exploring this idea, we touch upon the 
notion of multiple value creation and business models. We try to assess to what extend the 
technology of crypto-currency (e.g. blockchain) can be used to shape processes of multiple 
value creation in business models. From a sustainability perspective, the core of this 
technology is two-fold. It enables safe and hybrid peer to peer transactions without the 
interference of third parties and it allows people to use an array of values other than money. 
We propagate that this technology has the potential to accelerate a transition towards key 
values such as sustainability, inclusivity and circularity yet it has hardly been touched upon. 
The idea of sustainability addresses a long-standing debate concerning the interactions, 
including the use of, people have with their natural and social surroundings. It questions if 
these interactions are within the carrying capacities of the earth (Arrow, Bolin, Costanza, 
Dasgupta, et al., 1995). Since the start (Brundtland, 1987), this debate has provided us with 
many insights into the extent of the problem and the issues at hand. Social exclusion, natural 
depletion and growing (micro)pollution are just some of the many issues that urgently need 
to be addressed. Despite these insights sustained by a constant flow of viable facts, an 
actionable framework to address these problems within the carrying capacity of the earth 
and the socio-economic reality of everyday life is still missing. This becomes particularly 
visible when analysing the nature of the most common business models used to guide 
transactions in everyday economic life. At best sustainability is an add-on in these models. 
Sustainability can be addressed from a variety of perspectives. Here the transactional 
perspective is chosen since it enables framing the interactions between people relating to 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
135 
the use of a broad array of natural, social and artificial capitals (Porritt, 2007). It concerns a 
qualification of the interactions between human actions and the various capitals identified in 
the sustainability debate i.e., natural, human, social, financial, and constructed capital. These 
interactions are captured in a transactional framework. I.e., every interaction results in 
benefits (such as creation or maintenance) and costs (such as degradation, exclusion or 
depletion). This transactional perspective on human actions linked to a capitals discussion 
provides the foundations for a different breed of business models. 
This perspective is of particular interest here, since value creation takes shape in 
business models leading to capital conversion, growth and use. On the contrary conventional 
business models are driven by monetising all transactions. Monetization builds on the 
economic principle of valuing and of the substitution of capitals. Thus, transactions on 
natural, social and artificial capitals are all assigned a monetary value. This assumes (1) that 
all capitals obey to the same rules and principles and (2) the impact of transactions on these 
capitals is fully captured. Traditional economics perceive all transactions resulting from 
human actions on capitals from a monetary perspective. That is, each interaction is 
translated into a transaction that is financially valued. Limitations to this approach are 
abound. Most importantly, the valuation process taking place prior to and in transactions is 
inaccurate if not to say incomplete. Externalities i.e., those aspects of production and 
consumption that cannot or are not valued in terms of integrated prices or societal impact, 
are not taken into consideration. This leads to a flattered outcome since a considerable 
amount of expenses is not taken into account and thus not paid for in any way. Furthermore, 
monetisation heavily leans on the premise that all capitals are comparable and can be 
similarly valued in financial terms. Hence, valuation of transactions on capitals does not 
incorporate qualitative differences between the various capitals. 
For long this rather one-sided way of monetizing has been contested in the 
sustainability debate, known as ‘weak sustainability’. Basically, the critique articulated here 
is the ignorance of the nature of the various capitals at stake (Gutés, 1996). To 
operationalise the idea of a business model based on strong sustainability necessitates 
forms of multi-value transactions. The idea of ‘strong sustainability’ feeds into a new 
generation of business models based on a mixture of capitals expressed in terms of a broad 
variety of transactional means. This implies that means such as time, energy or even waste 
can be brought into the transaction simultaneously along-side money. We coin a 
transactional system that allows the use of a variety of means based on a variety of capitals 
driven logic and aiming at value preservation and creation ‘Hybrid Banking’ (HB). We 
distinguish a number of basic principles for hybrid banking. It starts from the perspective of 
fostering strong sustainability providing an alternative way of shaping and guiding 
transactions between constituents that are hybrid in their use of means. It does not agree on 
capital substitutability as a leading principle, that is common practice in traditional 
economics. On the contrary, Hybrid Banking (1) considers various capitals to be qualitatively 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
136 
different, (2) identifies that capitals cannot be substituted for other capitals, (3) recognizes 
that various capitals expressed as transactional means can be used simultaneously in 
transactions, (4) allows these means to be valued by the constituents involved in various 
wats and therefore (5) consequently abandons the dominant guiding principle of 
monetisation replacing is by a collective process of valuing. 
A question that arises is what technological infrastructure can support Hybrid Banking. 
Technology enabling the creation of crypto-currencies seems to provide the proper 
infrastructure for hybrid-value transactions. Although facing criticism (Bradbury, 2015), 
crypto-currencies have a long-standing tradition in closed yet large communities (Kim, 2015). 
Transactions registered in current systems form an open, public and distributed ledger 
anyone can access and assess (Dilley, Poelstra, Wilkins, Piekarska, et al., 2016). Other 
purposes are identified such as smart contracts and logistics leading to network-based ways 
of organising (Swan, 2015). As such it forms the perfect breeding grounds for business 
models that are designed to create multiple values. Often these models are instigated by 
groups of people, leading to so-called community-based business models. A starting point 
for a business model is invariably a group of people who give rise to an idea and to the 
development of that idea. These people organise a complex value that develops with a 
collective nature. Helping to create, invest, and realise implies sharing risks and benefits. 
Parties connect to each other on a basis of common interests, solutions, and stakes. Values 
at stake do not form a by-product, and they are not a consequence of good intentions, 
however. They are organised deliberately. This results in a community in which people 
benefit from what they organise together. Call this collective and shared value creation 
based on the use of various capitals. 
Using divers capitals driven by crypto-currency technology enables hybrid banking 
within those communities. This underlying technology or architecture enabling crypto 
currency is Blockchain. Blockchain technology encompasses a distributed administration of 
transactions. Information no longer resides at specific points in a network of people, but is 
shared among and accessible by all involved. Its distributed nature gives rise to new, non-
hierarchical configurations of organizations. Swan (2015) identifies three generations of 
Blockchain, starting with cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin) applications. The next step is formed 
by Smart Contracts (e.g., deeds of ownership, testaments, or birth certificates residing on 
the Blockchain). The third generation concerns smart organizations such as Distributed 
Autonomous Organizations (DAO). 
The implications of creating transactions based on this technology empowers a 
community to use innumerable transaction means, thus embedding a broad array of capitals 
in business models. This builds on the premise of strong sustainability. Yet replacing the 
current monetary system with a system of hybrid banking will be a transitional process full 
of institutional confrontations and technological challenges. A broad array of wicked

questions arises. What are the most proper transactional means? How are they linked either 
to the creation or degradation of various capitals? How to ensure the connection between 
the real-world capitals and the digital administration thereof? What is their impact on 
sustainability? How do transactions based on various capitals unfold? Ultimately this raises 
the issue of the preconditions that need to be met to realise a crypto currency or more 
general a Blockchain for hybrid banking?

Introduction  
Data represent the gold of tomorrow, but this does not happen automatically. Clever 
business models are required for the turnover. Especially, on the search for new and 
disruptive business or revenue models, respectively, data represent a crucial but yet still 
undervalued and underexploited key resource for sustainable innovation, optimisation and 
monetarisation.  
Established companies hope to turn their data (often in the form of experience) into 
gold: Manufacturing companies for instance can optimize their processes based on 
production data. Start-ups benefit from data from the outside and create value for instance 
by clever analytics, engaging data representation, and disruptive understanding of the 
domain.  
The current trend of automation and data-exchange in manufacturing technologies 
really lifted off with the term "Industrie 4.0", coined in a project in the high-tech strategy of 
the German government (BMBF 2016). However, this direction of thought has naturally 
motivated other business sectors as well to focus on the resources “data” and “experience” 
and benefit from them. The needs and desires are the same in each domain:  to infer 
valuable insights from existing or newly acquired data and to turn these insights into 
actionable knowledge that can be used to solve problems, improve the status quo or even 
lead to circular business model innovations introduced by Antikainen (2016). Often, 
companies do not have enough know-how for a good strategy or to create real value, and

how to deal with potential pitfalls and law regulations in the area of Big Data, and 
digitalisation adds another dimension of complexity to consider. 
Methodology  
To specify the current understanding of business models in the realm of Big Data, we used a 
qualitative approach analysing 25 Big Data projects spread over the domains of Retail, 
Energy, Production, and Life Sciences, and various company types (SME, group, start-up, 
etc.). All projects have been conducted in the last two years at Austria’s competence center 
for Data-driven Business and Big Data Analytics, the Know-Center.  
We analysed these projects by iteratively structuring as well as summarizing them 
alongside several dimensions (type, data, analytics, use case, revenue model etc.) to finally 
assign them in the categorisation matrix described by BITKOM (2013) – see Figure 1 - which 
is based on the Product-Market Ansoff (1965) Matrix, and classifies data-driven business 
models into the four areas Monetarisation (existing data, new business), Breakthrough (new 
data, new business), Optimisation (existing data, existing business) and Revaluation (new 
data, existing business). We hence followed Mayring’s (2000) method of a deductive 
qualitative content analysis.

Results and Discussion  
This analysis gives valuable insights regarding hot topics and aims of current Big Data 
projects in Austria (such as Personalised Health, Marketing and PR or Mobility), promising 
business models (such as SaaS Platforms or Data Market Places) as well as best practice 
examples allowing interested companies and stakeholders to get a starting point for 
developing data-driven business models and possible next steps depending on their current 
aims and strategy.

With respect to business models, more than half of the projects examined started with 
“Optimisation” (mostly targeted towards internal processes) in mind. All the projects directly 
aimed at “Monetarisation” (creating new business models with already existing data) also 
had to take a first “Optimisation” step. Most start-ups within this survey have been active in 
the Life Science area, which corresponds with our experience that biomedical data currently 
is a highly promising business domain with potential for a lot of niche solutions. 
Conclusion and Implications 
An enriched understanding of business models in the realm of Big Data contributes in 
describing of how an organization can create, deliver, and capture sustainable value on 
those newly emerging data volumes with the help of the right analytical tools, in economic, 
social, cultural or other contexts. The process of Big Data business model construction, 
amongst others for instance the collection, cleaning, analysis, visualisation, interpretation 
and exploitation of data, is an essential part of business strategy.  
For sure, the specification presented here is only one step of a longer journey to explore 
the potentials of digitalisation for business revenue streams. It will nevertheless help local 
business by providing them with a cheat sheet to understand their potentials and mining 
their gold out of Big Data.

Sharing platforms in the hotel industry: 
How sustainable are they?

Abstract 
Sharing platforms are considered a sustainable business model because by sharing, less 
durable goods are needed leading to less production of durable goods (Belk, 2010; Botsman 
and Rogers, 2010). The average car in North American and Western Europe is in use 8% of 
the time (Sacks, 2011) and the average electric drill is used 6 to 13 minutes over its lifetime 
(Belk, 2014). This illustrates that there is ample space for sharing durable goods. Whereas 
sharing is from all ages, digital platforms enable consumers to do it more efficiently and 
reach a wider network of other sharing consumers (Hamari et. al., 2015). One of the most 
prominent success stories of the sharing economy can be found in the travel industry. 
Internet platforms such as Airbnb, Flipkey, and Couchsurfing enable consumers to 
temporarily rent their property to other consumers. The largest platform, Airbnb, currently 
offers 3 million accommodations worldwide, of which 25.000 in the Netherlands 
(Airbnb.com). 
The business model of sharing platforms for accommodation is controversial for several 
reasons. First, hotels argue that it creates an unequal level playing field, because consumer 
rentals are exempted from most regulation and tax duties. Related to this, it is questionable 
whether all transactions through sharing platforms are truly consumer-to-consumer rentals 
or rather “(semi-)professional parties”-to-consumer rentals. Moreover, the critical issue is 
whether sharing platforms can be considered either as a complement or a substitute for 
hotel accommodations. If sharing platforms are complements they might be less sustainable 
than sometimes argued. That is, the availability of more priceworthy accommodations may 
induce more travelling, in this way even harming sustainability. However if sharing platforms 
are a substitute for hotels, and therefore the two are competing with each other, it urges 
hotels to revise their current business models in order to stay competitive.  
The rise of the sharing economy seems to cause only a modest concern within the hotel 
industry. Hotels might not know what to expect of this new type of market player and they 
lack insights into the developments. This is also due to the fact that the question why 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
142 
consumers choose for sharing alternatives is understudied and further changes in consumer 
behavior in the near future are uncertain. Mainly aggregate analyses (Zervas, Proserpio, & 
Byers, 2014) and anecdotic evidence is available, with the Finish article of Hamari, Sjöklint, & 
Ukkonen (2015) being one of the few studies taking a consumer perspective.  
This paper aims to bridge this knowledge gap for the hotel industry with a large 
representative survey among 2,591 Dutch consumers. Our research enables us to provide 
insights into the number of users (tenants and landlords) and their socio-demographic 
profile. We address the following questions: 1) To what extent are travelers aware of the 
existence of sharing platforms and what is their attitude towards them? 2) What are the 
main drivers of consumers for renting accommodation through sharing platforms? 3) What 
can be expected in the near future and how does this affect hotels? Through the use of  a 
questionnaire with multi-item construct measurements for perceived sustainability, 
perceived enjoyment, perceived extrinsic benefits of sharing platforms and overall attitude 
towards sharing platforms have been investigated. To gain insights in the current and future 
behavior of consumers in regard to sharing platforms multivariate regression models were 
estimated.   
We find that 52% of the Dutch population is familiar with sharing platforms for 
accommodation with Airbnb as best known platform. Mostly higher educated and younger 
consumers (<35 years) make use of these sharing platforms, but our results show that other 
age groups (35-44 and 45-55) are inclined to start using sharing platforms in the near future. 
Both financial attractiveness and perceived enjoyment contribute to consumers’ positive 
attitudes towards sharing platforms, but only enjoyment actually drives consumer intentions 
for using sharing accommodations. Remarkably, consumers who perceive the sustainable 
benefits of sharing highly are less likely to use sharing platforms for accommodation. Though 
our calculations reveal that the expected number of consumers using sharing platforms for 
accommodation will significantly grow, the traveler segment that completely ignores hotels 
and only uses sharing alternatives remains marginal. As such, our results suggest that that 
sharing platforms will gain a more prominent place in the market next to hotels, thereby 
offering both a substitute and a complement in the market for overnight stays. 
On base of the results we draw conclusions on the business model of sharing platforms 
for accommodation. We discuss to what extent sharing platforms such as Airbnb can be 
considered sustainable since sustainability seems to have a rather negative instead of 
positive influence on the intended use of sharing platforms. Secondly sharing can stimulate 
additional travelling and thereby put a greater strain on the environment. Furthermore due 
to the very low percentage of consumers renting out their properties one can ask if there 
really is a sharing economy or that it is mainly semi-professional organizations that offer 
accommodation through sharing platforms rather than consumers renting out their 
temporarily unused living spaces. We also discuss the implications for the hotel industry and

for other sharing platforms. In fact, hotels must adjust their business model in order to stay 
competitive with this new market player.

Building and animating a regional business 
model shifting display? 
The Hauts-De-France case first. 
Demissy Romain, 
Associated Adviser - Researcher (ATEMIS) r.demissy@atemis-lir.com

Abstract  
The French Hauts-de-France Region experiments with a new way to deal with economic and 
business models shifting. This experience is based on a regional policy innovation in the way 
the institution accompany enterprises in their path toward a new economic model inspired 
by the functional and cooperative economy model (Gaglio, Lauriol & du Tertre 2011; 
Benqué, du Tertre, Vuidel 2014). The innovation itself consists in building and animating a 
Functional and Innovative Environment (FIE) that embody in several local displays (Demissy 
& Kniaz 2016). Those displays support: community animation, broadcasting of enterprises 
new model, entrepreneurs and local institutions employees training, enterprises’ director 
accompaniment and developing new accompaniment tools and displays.  
This experiment lasts for 5 years now. The FIE core actor, the Club Noé, decided to lead 
the first evaluation of the FIE performance for the enterprises part of the community and 
engaged in a path toward Functional and Cooperative Economy. This contribution presents 
the most significant results of this evaluation, linking them to the FIE displays. The rather 
positive results do not mean that there are no questions left. In fact, those results revealed 
to the local actors and their partners some new questions which needed to be investigated.  
Shifting from and industrially inspired business model toward a servicial one such as 
Functional and Cooperative Economy, means some changes about labour conception and 
the way it is organised and evaluated (Blandin 2013, du Tertre 2007; du Tertre 2009). To 
accompany such changes means other displays than the one in motion nowadays. Take a 
servicial way of thinking on also change the way solutions are designed. Concepting solution 
in a Functional and Innovative Environment means cooperation between the community 
members but it also raises the complexity level of such a conception. At last, a more servicial 
activity claims for different evaluation displays able to consider immaterial effects with 
environmental ones. This is necessary to evaluated all the aspect of sustainability about the 
new solutions developed.  

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
146 
 
The Functional and Innovative Environment displays have already started to evolve, 
and investigations are in progress for some of the questions mentioned. The paper 
concludes on how relevant are the Functional and Innovative Environment implementations 
and what should be done to improve it any further. At last, we will propose an analysis of 
what is lacking nowadays to the Functional and Innovative Environment to impulse a more 
massive economic and business model shifting movement at a regional scale.  
In terms of method, the paper is organised in four parts. First a synthesis of the two 
evaluations produced by the Club Noe. The first evaluation is a qualitative one, taking the 
form of some interviews lead with accompanied enterprises’ directors. The second is a 
quantitative evaluation about the effect of the Functional and Cooperative Economy 
accompaniment display. Both evaluations are quite recent (2016). Then, we will analyse the 
links that can be identified between some of the results and the Functional and Innovative 
Environment displays. From the results and some business cases we will then list some of 
the questions the community – actors involved in the Club Noe - is facing now. We will 
expose the initiatives taken from now to investigates those questions. At last, we will 
analyse the project and the plausible evolution for the Functional and Innovative 
Environment displays.

The role of regional business models in the 
transition towards mercury-free gold mining

Abstract 
Mercury is used in various sectors like the medical sector, but causes particularly concerns in 
Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining (ASGM) for health and environmental reasons. 
Although it must be underlined that not all ASGM miners use mercury, ASGM is to date the 
largest anthropogenic source of mercury emissions worldwide. Among the mercury users, 
ASGM miners are the most vulnerable groups due to several socioeconomic, technical, and 
political reasons. ASGM attracts about 15 million people in about 70 countries in Asia, Latin 
America and Africa who produce on average 400 metric tons of gold per year, representing 
15% of the global primary mine production. In these regions, agriculture is often the only 
other option. Studies and programmes on ASGM are mainly focussed on technical solutions 
to reduce and eliminate mercury. Studies and programmes that consider all site 
characteristics comprehensively (i.e., available techniques, geology, socioeconomics, politics, 
regulations, etc.) are missing to provide adapted solutions. Such kind of information is 
however typically what business models look at to develop sustainable markets. This is the 
reason why research in business models is needed in this sector to support a fair and 
sustainable transition of miners towards mercury-free techniques. Indeed, while 
international regulations and pressures from various stakeholders are increasing to 
(progressively) eliminate mercury-use in ASGM like the Minamata Convention on Mercury, 
several researchers keep on claiming the need to consider the site-specific characteristics of 
the activity. In line with this perspective, this conceptual paper builds on concepts from the 
business model field of research to advocate the need for bottom-up approaches and 
highlight the essential contributions the business model field can make to the sector. A focus 
is set on ASGM miners, their communities and the role of donors and governments who are 
among the most relevant stakeholder to provide financial support and regulatory 
frameworks in the sector. The research question addressed is “How can business model 
concepts support the mercury-free transition of ASGM miners and their community?” It is 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
148 
shown that depending on the degree of economic stability of ASGM sites, different focuses 
in business models are recommended that are not necessarily mercury-related. In particular, 
poverty alleviation and trainings are sine qua non conditions for the success of the mercury-
free transition, as well as the redesign of donors’ business models and their value 
proposition. It is concluded that business models are particularly useful to answer the site-
specific needs of ASGM miners and their communities and engage stakeholders in a dialog to 
find sustainable solutions for ASGM sites where mercury is used. This conceptual paper has 
implications for both researchers and practitioners. For researcher, it lays the ground for an 
important and very relevant research gap to be further investigated. For practitioners like 
donors and policy-makers, the recommendations made, if positively tested on the ground, 
imply considerable changes in current practices, objectives, stakeholder engagement 
activities, and priority setting.

Designing case study research for the exploration of 
strategy formation in hubs

Abstract 
This contribution sets out to develop a valid research design which accommodates the 
development of a theory in practice (Corbin & Strauss, 2008) about the process of strategy 
development in evolving territorial forms of organising called hubs. Hubs are thick, 
polymorph and polycentric networks driven by practitioners, shaped around multiple, 
wicked and interlinked problems, shared interests, and shared principles (Kamm, Faber, & 
Jonker, 2016). Throughout Europe we observe an increasing involvement of a broad range of 
constituents including civilians in these emerging networking forms of organizing, enabling 
multiple value creation in a cooperative manner while aiming for sustainable transitions on a 
regional scale.  
Constituents invest in hubs through various means such as time, energy, money, and 
other resources that contribute to addressing collaborative solutions for multi-faceted, 
‘wicked’ problems (Faber & Jonker, 2015; Weber & Khademian, 2008).  They commonly 
benefit from the results generated by processes of multiple, collective, and shared value 
creation (Faber & Jonker, 2015). Our objective is to develop a valid methodological 
framework which accommodates the building of a general explanation (Yin, 2009) about the 
process of strategy development in hubs. It is argued that multiple longitudinal, 
retrospective case studies are obligatory in order to understand how the process of crafting 
a strategy emerges in individual hubs. We will test and adjust our methodological framework 
by conducting three case studies in the spring of 2017. Preliminary findings on both the 
methodological framework and the results of the case studies will be presented.

Constituents in hubs engage intentionally and implicitly in a process of shaping a 
strategy in order to realize diverse goals via diverse means. How this process of strategy 
formation takes place in hubs and under which conditions remains an open question. Hubs 
are a new and recent (<10 years) phenomenon that has not been researched previously. Our 
challenge is to accommodate a valid case study research, which enables the exploration of 
three interrelated and simultaneous developments that can be observed in emerging hubs: 
i). organisational development, ii). strategy development, and iii). development of multiple 
value creating goals and activities.  Gaining substantial (Fiss, 2011) context-related 
(Flyvbjerg, 2006)  knowledge  about the evolvement of these three developments across 
various hubs is an important step in our research. To investigate this, a case study approach 
that accommodates the exploration of the strategizing process in European hubs is being 
developed. The methodological design of the case studies is grounded in an epistemological 
framework that deliberately combines two different approaches by starting with an 
interpretive approach (Avenier & Thomas, 2015) of the case studies and a configurative 
approach (Schneider & Wagemann, 2012) of the analysis of the cases, aiming to unravel 
causal relations between organisational, strategic and value creating processes in hubs, and 
providing foundations for a grounded theory development (Corbin & Strauss, 2008) based 
on the case studies. This design is chosen to enable the combination of within-case 
knowledge about hubs as social constructs (Avenier & Thomas, 2015) with cross-case 
comparison by transforming cases into configurations of conditions for the occurrence 
(Berg-Schlosser, De Meur, Rihoux, & Ragin, 2009) of strategizing and value creating 
processes.  
Hubs can be recognized by seven general properties (Faber & Jonker, 2015, Kamm et al., 
2016). These are: (i). Operating in a local or regional setting; (ii). addressing wicked 
problems; (iii). leading to a broad configuration of constituents; (iv). engaging in multiple 
value creating activities which facilitate the cooperative crossover between the social and 
the economic domain; (v). open, dynamic, often unconventional, organizational structure in 
which constituents participate on the basis of equality; (vi). issue related approach; (vii). 
leading to a transition over time.  Based on these properties an information oriented 
selection (Flyvbjerg, 2006) of cases (N = 6) will be established in order to enable longitudinal 
case studies of hubs that furthermore (i). have an addressable organizational level, (ii). have 
information available about their choice directing, decision making, and strategy developing 
activities, and (iii). are involved in multiple value creating projects. Acknowledging the 
possible significance of different circumstances under which hubs form, the research focuses 
on diverse (Seawright & Gerring, 2008) cases which encompass maximum variation 
(Flyvbjerg, 2006). We aim to do so by selecting hubs that are  (i) initiated by different actors 
(e.g. entrepreneurs, governmental bodies, and civil society initiatives), (ii) have different 
organisational structures (e.g. coop, foundation, association), and (iii) are located in different 
European countries.

A methodological framework is being developed for the collection and analysis of data 
from the selected cases, starting with a historical process reconstruction (Mintzberg, 1978; 
Mintzberg, Ahlstrand, & Lampel, 1998). It will be based on multiple sources including but not 
limited to notes, policy documents, newsletters and social media. Based on content analysis 
a historical reconstruction of the development of each hub will be constructed and key 
participants will be selected for group meetings per hub. During these group meetings key 
participants of the hub will be invited to discuss the historical reconstruction and to signal 
and explicate critical (i.e. important organizational, strategic and value creating) events in 
the development of the hub. Interviews (semi structured and open) will subsequently be 
conducted with selected respondents who have been identified as being involved with goal 
setting and decision-making processes related to the identified critical events. In order to 
enable the determination of causal relations between organizational, strategic and value 
creating processes related to critical events in hubs a set theoretic approach (Schneider & 
Wagemann, 2012) will be applied for data analysis based on the information gathered during 
group sessions and interviews. During the spring and early summer of 2017 we will conduct 
three consecutive case studies in the Netherlands to test and adjust our methodological 
framework.  
Information from the Dutch cases and further case studies in other European countries 
will eventually lead to a framework for theory building on the strategizing process in hubs 
based on comparative case studies and set theoretic data interpretation. This framework will 
ultimately be used for the development of a model of the strategizing process(es) in hubs 
which will be elaborated, tested, and analysed through process simulation.

Abstract 
Industrial symbiosis (IS) engages traditionally separate industries in a collective approach to 
competitive advantage (Chertow, 2000) by exchanging underused resources from an entity 
to another one, which use them as a substitute for new resources (Deutz, 2014). IS extends 
the traditional business relations, exploiting resources with low intrinsic value and no 
marketplace. It creates a more sophisticated value conglomerate (Jacobsen, 2006), 
combining value forms initiated by operational, environmental, economic (Chertow and 
Lombardi, 2005), social and territorial benefits (Maillefert and Robert, 2015). These values 
must be identified, qualitatively and quantitatively assessed, and captured in specific 
business models (BM) dedicated to each stakeholder. 
In the perspective of developing generic business cases to widely implement the IS 
concept, this contribution will detail several specific profiles of IS stakeholders, show how 
they can capture values, how they can internalise the externalities, and how the individual 
BMs can connect in collaborative schemes. 
The types of IS relationships are diverse and complex. They involve a network of at least 
three actors (Boons et al., 2016), broadening the traditional bilateral B2B contract. Beyond 
the two central stakeholders exchanging an underused resource, external beneficiaries are 
always involved, such as neighbouring companies, free-rider local communities and more 
conceptual entities such as culture, nature and/or society. Additional third parties are often 
included, such as facilitators, utilities, financers, or other satellite industrial facilities. 
Industrial companies usually consider their BM in a traditional way, balancing the 
expected revenues and the related costs and constraints, while they could boost their BM by

internalising non-monetised values, called “soft” values. Such values can be directly 
internalised if they impact the own stakeholder’s activity or through more complex 
mechanisms if they impact external third parties. They may be grasped by private entities on 
the territory or by the local/regional/national public authorities, depending on the 
geographic scale of the synergy’s impact and its nature. These values may then be returned 
to the central partners through innovative BMs or support mechanisms.  
The relevance of economic and “soft” values depends on each stakeholder typology. At 
the micro-level (central stakeholders), BMs consider mainly economic and market-based 
values even though empirical examples show that “soft” values can also be sufficient to 
further trigger engagement. At the meso-level (neighbouring stakeholders), BMs would 
foster economic values for private stakeholders (e.g. utility company) and benefits of general 
interest (social, environmental, economic development) for public and local authorities. At 
the macro-level, distant stakeholders are mainly impacted by externalities of general 
interest (e.g. reduction of GHG has an impact at global level). This multi-scale description will 
be illustrated through an IS instance of district heating network in Dunkirk (France). 
As in any business initiative, IS business cases must be viable for every single 
stakeholder in order to enhance the interest level of decision-makers. It is especially true for 
the central synergy partners who invest money and expect direct profits (micro/meso-level). 
However, profitability – in its traditional economic definition – is often a bottleneck in IS 
initiatives for such stakeholders. This contribution intends to deepen the understanding of 
the networking economy created through IS, investigating how far the various synergetic 
values can be transferred at different levels, and therefore unlock the global economic 
viability of synergies.

Introduction 
Developing business models for sustainability is a means to conceptualise transforming our 
production and consumption systems away from low impact, incremental change (Bocken et 
al. 2013; Boons & Lüdeke-Freund, 2013). However, despite extensive technical knowledge 
regarding strategies to reduce negative impacts, we’re not implementing new business 
models at sufficient speed to address sustainability challenges, suggesting social science 
research on sustainability is a limiting factor (Agyeman, 2011). Moreover, to accelerate the 
transition to an equitable sustainable society, attention needs to be given to how power is 
conceptualised at organizational and societal levels (Avelino & Rotmans, 2011; Agyeman, 
2011). 
In this abstract we argue that to catalyze innovation and embed sustainability, 
organizations need to better understand how to use their influence to craft network-based 
business models which create multiple forms of value for themselves and the wider 
network. We explore this thesis through a comparative qualitative case study of one in-
depth multi-party case of how Adnams' plc. regional business models contribute to 
sustainable value creation in the region of East Anglia, UK. We use a conceptual framework, 
based on Archer (1995), to analyse Adnams’ influence in these business models. Our findings 
suggest that sustainability pioneers like Adnams, have direct and indirect value creation 
strategies and some of these business models are characterised by the principle of “paying it 
forward” and cultural lock-in. 
Methodology 
We present a qualitative in-depth multi-party case study of how Adnams plc.’s, a UK values-
led regional brewery, shapes eight local SMEs and regional development organizations 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
157 
business models in its’ business ecosystem. Traditionally, in business ecosystem research, 
collective value creation for a community of organizations is characterised by a single 
platform business model (Moore, 1993; Moore, 1996; Nachira et al. 2007). In contrast, we 
define business ecosystems as networks of organizations whose relationships are 
characterised by individual, or multiple, business models. 
Building on Margaret Archer’s concepts of first and second order power (Archer, 1995) 
we analyse and interpret Adnams’ influence in these business model relationships. Archer’s 
resource-dependency framing distinguishes between: structural resources, (physical goods 
or man-made artefacts); and cultural resources, (concepts and ideas). This contrasts with 
resource-dependency theories which do not interrogate how different resource types 
impact influence and subsequently sustainable value creation, over emphasising structural 
resources. 
Findings 
Our findings illustrate that firstly; power differentials have differing impacts on sustainable 
value creation based on the resource configurations and degree of dependency. This 
suggests counterintuitively that business models, underpinned by relationships with similar 
power differential profiles, require distinct strategies to drive innovation which optimises 
value creation. 
Secondly, Adnams’ use their influence to create regional value in two ways –  direct 
interactions with local SME’s via initiatives like their sustainability supply-chain initiative (SSI) 
and indirectly through influencing the region's development e.g.  as a Green Economy 
Pathfinder.   
Adnams’ support of SMEs to develop and grow their brands is a direct value creation 
strategy. This is neither completely altruistic, nor completely efficient as it is not necessarily 
driven by an immediate financial return or benefit. Adnams recognise that investing in local 
SMEs creates future value which cannot be wholly anticipated -  a paying it forward 
approach. The benefits are evidenced by Adnams' ability to “punch above their weight” in 
the region based on higher influence than their economic size (structural resource) would 
suggest. 
Adnams’ use of their influence as a sustainability pioneer to shape regional investment 
creating opportunities for local SMEs is an in-direct value creation strategy. Adnams' 
leadership in regional initiatives contributes to mainstreaming of sustainability values 
(cultural resources), creating a favourable investment environment (structural resource) for 
local SMEs, who incorporate sustainability values in their core business models, Adnams 
included, contributing to competitive advantage.

Thirdly, some of Adnams’ regional business models were characterised by cultural lock-
in. Adnams’ sustainability values (cultural resources) reinforces remaining in business 
models based on shared  sustainability values. Thus Adnams’ behaviour was constrained by 
the need to be aligned with their stated values inorder to maintain their reputation. 
Conclusion 
This research illustrates the importance of understanding power relations in regional 
business models. Our findings have theoretical implications for the business model and 
strategic management literature. We conclude by outlining practical recommendations for 
how organizations can develop regional business models which create multiple forms of 
value, in the context of power relations.

Transition of business models towards 
business models for sustainability:  
 Insights from four Austrian companies about 
opportunities, drivers and barriers

Abstract  
Based on negative trends like climate change, dwindling resources, the pollution of air and 
soil as well as social grievances, more and more attention is paid to sustainability and 
sustainable development. Nowadays, there is already a common accordance amongst 
society, politicians and academics that companies have the power to contribute to 
sustainable development by changing their business model towards a more sustainable one. 
Within the scientific literature the business model concept has received lots of attention in 
recent years and also sustainable business models get more relevant, even though there is a 
lack in definition about this concept. But it is evident that only a holistic integration of 
sustainability into the company’s business model is meaningful.  
Therefore, this contribution aims to answer the questions about how business models 
are changing due to the rising importance of sustainability and what are influencing factors 
within the transition process, as well as which internal and external barriers might hinder 
companies in the transition towards a business model for sustainability (BMfS) and what are 
internal and external drivers that promote changing the business model. Furthermore, the 
role of relevant stakeholders, like customers or employees, during the process of change is 
investigated.  
This contribution is based on a master thesis and highlights the most relevant findings. 
For answering the questions, theoretical as well as empirical research is conducted. 
Theoretical research is based on an in-depth analysis of existing scientific literature dealing 
with the concept of business models and business strategy, the change of business models 
including business model innovation and business model transition and finally of linking 
sustainability to the concept of business models in order to deal with BMfS. The empirical

part consists of qualitative, interview-based case studies about Austrian companies that 
successfully have changed their business model into a business model for sustainability. The 
business cases were selected by making an extended internet research about companies 
that act sustainable, in order to further investigate whether they have really integrated 
sustainability within their business model and if their business model changed significantly 
from a conventional one towards a business model for sustainability. Whereby about 13 
companies were identified. Four of these companies were finally chosen as case studies and 
semi-structured interviews based on an interview-guideline were conducted. The interviews 
were transcribed and a content analysis with support of the tool MAXQDA was done.   
The results show that BMfS are likely to be the future of our economy, even though the 
transition process from a conventional business model towards a business model for 
sustainability is a slow and sometimes difficult process, but according to all interviewees it is 
worth it and none of the selected companies regrets the change. Several requirements need 
to be fulfilled in order to make the change possible. The barriers, which are mainly based on 
lacking resources, financial, human and time resources, are possible to overcome. The 
identified drivers for changing the business model, like a more efficient value chain, multiple 
value creation, or the development of new products, customer or markets, have outweighed 
the barriers for the interviewees. But it should be noted, that the companies chosen for the 
empirical research are still exceptions and the majority of companies do not (yet) integrate 
sustainability in their business model and into their core business. It can be concluded that 
business models for sustainability are a promising concept for the future, but further 
research is required in order to strengthen the concept in the scientific community, but as 
well to provide a solid basis of information to the companies. The results of the underlying 
research show that when fulfilling several requirements, the transition towards a business 
model for sustainability is possible for different types of companies, either service or 
production or both, from different sectors and with different structures.

The impact of digitalization on business 
models: 
An analysis from a sustainability point of view

Abstract 
Digitalization nowadays is a commonly known term and its progress does not only influence 
our daily private lives, but also the way business is done (Keuper et al., 2013). Digitalization 
is not just the transfer of digital data, it is more or less the change of our personal 
environment to an ‘always on’ community (Keuper et al., 2013). By the means of this 
interconnection, several business opportunities and business areas emerged. These 
disruptive business models, where given products or services get totally new aspects, due to 
technical or digital progress, are challenging existing businesses (Scheer, 2016). Therefore, 
sustainability management is important as a core task, in managing rapid change. If there is 
danger of a lack of human adaptation, it is important to create resilient relationships 
between human systems and a digital environment (Scholz, 2016). 
In this context, the chosen field of research is the energy sector, which is facing severe 
changes due to digitalization. The usual business model of energy providers, namely the 
production, sale and delivery of power is endangered. Shifted customer needs, higher 
energy efficiency and decentralized power production are only a few aspects which 
challenge the energy providers. (Ionescu, 2012) On the other hand, solutions to 
environmental problems require long-term strategies for environmentally beneficial 
improvement. The energy sector is often mentioned, when it comes to solutions for a 
sustainable development (Dincer, 2000). Especially in smart grids, the digitalization brings 
enormous potential for innovation and sustainable benefits (Rodríguez-Molina et al., 2014). 
Also block-chain technology has the potential to shape certain parts of the energy market 
substantially. (Hasse et al., 2016)

Some lead questions that should be answered in the following research are: 
 Which new possibilities arise through the influence of digitalization in the energy 
sector? 
 Which new business models are emerging in the energy sector through digitalization 
processes? 
o Does digitalization change the creation of value in the existing business model 
of actors in the energy sector? 
o Do these assumptions also change the delivery and capture of values in the 
business models of the actors in the energy sector? 
 Is sustainability, in context with digitalization, a driver for the change of business 
models for utilities? 
After a systematic literature review, the empirical part of the thesis is to accomplish 
qualitative research. Interviews with experts from the energy sector, mainly from utilities 
and energy providers, are conducted in order to get insight into current practice and ideas. 
The interviews are done with a semi-structured interview guideline and are than analyzed in 
the form of a qualitative content analysis. The analysis after Mayring should guarantee a 
comprehensible examination of the achieved data and should ideally support the answering 
of the research questions. (Bortz, Döring, 2003) The goal is to accomplish a case study, of a 
not yet defined number of cases from the energy sector. A multiple case-study design with 
embedded units of analysis should help to answer the stated questions of the study. It also 
should check if the propositions are valid and if the data can be linked to a clear 
interpretation of the results. (Yin, 2013) 
The expected results should clarify, to what extent the ongoing digitalization, has an 
impact on existing business models, for the energy sector. Therefore, a strong focus is on 
smart grids, which are a prime example for the influence of digitalization. As smart grids are 
inseparable in context to decentralized power production, literature as suggested that 
Austrian utilities could be more active in fostering business models in this regard (Gsodam et 
al., 2015). The view on best practice examples of smart grids, should provide an overview 
about the potential for new business models and should deliver conclusions to the 
researched cases. As the installation of smart ammeters, which are a premise for smart 
grids, is regulated by law, a look at this situation, should also show if the energy sector is 
merely complying with law or is using the opportunities for innovations. Also, the question, 
whether sustainability plays a role for the actors in the energy sector, in shaping their 
business models, should be clarified throughout the research. Literature suggests In this 
context, that digitalization offers huge potentials, for a sustainable way of power production.

Abstract 
Nowadays we still have the economic system, which arose from the industrial revolution. In 
this economy, referred to as the ‘linear economy’, raw materials are used to make products 
and at the end of their lifecycle they will end up as waste (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 
2013). Our current system focuses mainly on one value, maximizing the profit. This results in 
a negative impact on the natural and social environment. The demand for multiple value 
creation is getting stronger. Therefore, the transition from linear to circular economy is 
essential (Jonker, 2015; TNO, 2013). 
A major change is also needed in the conservative construction and demolition industry.  
The CO2 emission of a steel beam is 480kg CO2 per tonne. The amount of emission released 
during the process is a sum of the production of raw materials, transportation to site, 
installation costs, demolition and waste disposal (Bouwen met Staal, 2017). This is 
equivalent to two times back and forth from Amsterdam to Graz by car. In the current 
situation a building will be demolished and eventually all pieces of steel from the building 
will be sold back to the steel manufacturers as scrap. These manufacturers are melting the 
steel scrap into new steel. This process still causes a lot of emission, which is a major 
disadvantage. Reusing steel beam constructions is the perfect solution to solve this problem. 
Waste of buildings will be reused as raw material for new buildings. In this situation steel 
comes on step higher on the Lansink’s ladder (Jurriëns, 2015). 
Previous research shows many difficulties and barriers to reuse steel in building 
constructions (CIB General Secretariaat Rotterdam, 2014;Densley Tingley, Cooper & Cullen, 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
167 
2015; Hradil, 2014). There is a lot of information in the steel construction industry but 
sharing between the partners is quite limited, not to mention the cooperation in the chain. 
Besides the cost and market demand, it appears that supply chain dynamics and availability 
are the biggest barriers to reuse steel. If there is no supply of reused steel in the industry, it 
is more difficult to create demand or even to make use of it.   
In order to achieve a circular model with reused steel in the construction and demolition 
industry, it is mentioned that the supply of reused steel is the most important part to 
change. This problem results in the following problem statement of this research: “How 
should in the demolition industry the current material flow of used construction steel from 
non-residential buildings change in order to be offered as donor steel and fit into a new 
business model?” 
This research takes part of a larger project called ‘Hoger op de Ladder” (HopLa).1 The 
HopLa project consists of two parts, the first part focuses on design for disassembly and the 
second part focuses on reuse of second hand steel (Avans Hogeschool, 2016). This research 
is related to the second part of the project. 2 
Firstly, a literature study is conducted. This is because there is already a lot to find about 
this topic in the literature. This literature study is used to create context for this study and is 
used as input for the qualitative field research. Secondly, qualitative field research has been 
conducted to compare this to the results of the literature study and to acquire new insights. 
For the qualitative field research, there has been taken about twenty interviews with parties 
from the construction and demolition industry or with experts about circular economy. 
To answer the problem statement, the research is divided into four parts. It starts very 
wide with the current situation and future of the construction and demolition industry. The 
second part is the current material flow of the demolition industry, this is already a bit 
narrower. And the third part is about the reuse of construction steel. This three part should 
be answered first before the fourth part can be answered. This fourth part shows the new 
business model for the supply of reused steel. 
This research about the supply side in the supply chain of reused steel covers one part 
of a tripartite research. By putting this research together with the two other parts, about the 
demand and the ‘marketplace’ of reused steel, a new circular business model will be 
designed and deployed for reused steel in non-residential buildings within the construction 
and demolition industry.

Abstract 
The ideas of our current linear economy are no longer sustainable. In this economy materials 
are extracted by companies, energy is applied to manufacture products and these products 
are being sold to end-users who dispose them when they no longer serve their purpose 
(Jonker, 2012; Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013). Increasingly there is a need for a shift 
towards a circular economy (Jonker 2014; Jurriëns, 2015). The key issue in this circular 
economy is preserving value; the ambition is to extent the life cycle of products. It is about 
maximizing the reusability of products and raw materials, and minimizing the destruction of 
value (MVO Nederland, 2016; Faber & Jonker, 2016; Jurriëns, 2015). 
The need for this outlined change is also recognized within the steel construction 
industry in The Netherlands. Steel belongs to the five most requested base materials. The 
production carries about twenty-five percent of the total industrial CO2 emissions (TNO, 
2013). The value of the current circularity mode, which consists mainly of recycling, is even 
negative (Jurriëns, 2015). The circularity of steel needs to go to a higher level on the Ladder 
van Lansink1, by taking the step from recycling to reuse2. Reuse assures the deployability of 
‘captured energy’ and consumes less raw materials and energy, which leads to a reduced 
environmental impact compared to recycling (Expertisecentrum Sustainable Business [ESB], 
2016).

By ending the product life cycle of this used steel as a raw material for a new building 
and taking the first steps to the described transition, the whole chain faces some difficulties 
and barriers that make it challenging to come to an introduction of a new business model for 
structural steel reuse. These barriers are experienced both in the demand for reused steel 
and in the supply of this particular material. It is a chain-wide problem, so in order to solve 
this problem the entire chain must be investigated. Therefore this thesis covers one part of a 
tripartite research3, the aim is of these researches is to design a new business model for the 
whole steel construction industry.  
This thesis is especially focused on the demand for reused steel. The following research 
question is designed: ‘How should the process of demand for reused steel be arranged in 
order to fit into a new business model within the steel construction industry?’ . The answer to 
this question will show how the process of demand for reused steel must be arranged in 
order to be a part of the new business model within the steel construction industry that will 
be designed. Eighteen weeks will be spent to do research in order to give a thorough answer 
to the formulated research question of this thesis. 
Firstly the literature study and qualitative research will be used to provide knowledge 
and insights in the current situation within the steel construction industry. By using in-depth 
interviews important information about the creation of the current demand for steel will be 
gained from the various partners in the market, which are involved in the process of 
demand. Besides that, insights will be obtained about potential motivations and incentives, 
current barriers and their attitude towards the demand for reused steel.  
Secondly the desired situation will be developed, based on the outlined current 
situation. The potential motivations and incentives will be transformed into a specifically 
designed demand for reused steel and the barriers will be tackled, so they do not obstruct 
the demand anymore. Briefly this situation will describe how the demand process of the 
partners needs to be arranged to attend to the desired transition to circularity within the 
steel construction industry.  
Finally this research provides the base for a circular demand arrangement for reused 
steel within the new business model that will be designed and deployed for the whole steel 
construction industry.

Abstract 
The recent global economic crisis has raised fundamental questions about the impact of 
existing corporate business models (Schaltegger, Hansen, & Lüdeke-Freund, 2016). There is a 
transition needed from our current linear economy into a more circular one, focused on 
creating multiple values and the reuse of materials (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013). Products 
in the end of their lifecycle are the raw material for new products (Jonker & Faber, 2016). This 
change is needed because our current economic ways of production are no longer 
sustainable, natural resources are exhausted and the carbon emission is still too high (Jonker, 
2012). 
With a view to sustainability, companies are realizing their need to create a win-win 
situation and are adapting to this with new solutions (Rauter, Jonker, & Baumgartner, 2015). 
However, to engage in a change process is unusual in the Dutch construction industry; many 
projects were put in the ‘too difficult box’. The business is conservative; the focus is on 
attaining the lowest price instead of the highest quality (Jurriëns, 2015). Business models are 
focused on how a firm is able to earn money (Boons & Lüdeke-Freund, 2012). Where other 
branches already changed to a more service orientated business model where value creation 
is 
important, 
the 
construction 
industry 
lacks 
behind 
(Rotmans, 
2010). 
This bachelor thesis lasting for 18 weeks focuses on barriers and motivations for the 
implementation of a new business model for steel reuse. Steel is known for its high-energy 
demand. It is suitable for reuse because it does not lose its quality with a technical lifetime 
of 100 years (Henrar, 2012). Previous research has shown that there are some major barriers 
for change. The most important ones are the costs, while the price is the key criterium in this 
sector. Besides the costs, people do not know that it is available, which qualifications it has 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
173 
and where to find it. There is a lack of awareness, information and integration (Hadril, 2013; 
Cullen, Cooper & Densley Tingley, 2015).  
The purpose of the study is to stimulate the reuse of steel within the construction 
industry. It is a part of the HopLa project1. This thesis is part of a bigger research and focuses 
on the match between supply and demand. The other parts focus on supply and demand 
itself. The aim is to develop a new business model for the construction industry to foster the 
circular economy. The research question is: How should the process be arranged to match 
supply and demand of second-hand steel for constructions of non-residential buildings to 
realise a new business model? 
Firstly, this research shows barriers for the match between demand and supply. 
Secondly, an approach to solve these barriers is proposed, using literature and desk research 
and conducting in-depth interviews.  
Thirdly, a new business model will be created. The output will be a ‘marketplace’ for 
second-hand steel where demand and supply meet.   
With the new business model, where circularity is the key feature, added value is 
created on other aspects than the mere price or the costs involved. Such as ecological 
quality, indicated by carbon emission and the exhaustion of natural resources. This 
marketplace should resolve the lack of awareness, information and integration. Important is 
that there is an overview available off all steel suitable for reuse in a database to increase 
availability, steel must have the right quality ensured, storage is needed and the government 
will have to get involved. It will be a lot easier to locate, identify and implement the reuse of 
steel in the design at an early stage. The high costs will be eliminated when practices 
become more standardized (Gorgolewski, 2006). Availability will increase and the parts will be 
in the right place, on the right time, with the right amounts. Reuse will be available off the 
shelves and it will bring us one step closer to a circular economy.

Social Entrepreneurship and its Values:  
A Complexity Perspective 
Dieter Gutschi – University of Graz (Master Thesis)  
Dieter.Gutschi@gmx.net 
Abstract 
Social entrepreneurship is often perceived as a panacea for the complex sustainability issues 
that humanity faces in the 21st century (Hall et al., 2010). As such, research interest in this 
topic has been growing significantly over the years, but a major part still focuses on the 
definition and scope of the concept (Dacin et al., 2010; Weerawardena and Sullivan Mort, 
2006). In contrast, the intersection of values and social entrepreneurship has hardly been 
explored so far (Harris et al., 2009). The thesis investigates the values of atempo—an 
Austria-based social enterprise—from a complexity perspective. Thereby a new approach to 
the investigation of values is created and a first exploration of the specific values in the field 
of social entrepreneurship conducted.  
A literature review takes a closer look at the core concepts of social entrepreneurship, 
complexity and value theory. The results are a criteria list for identifying social enterprises 
and a complexity-understanding of values, which mostly derives from the work of Cilliers 
(2000). The criteria list shows that atempo is an adequate study object. Based on Kurtz's 
(2014) concept of participatory narrative inquiry, a value research approach is developed 
that sees values as emergent phenomena (Painter-Morland, 2006). It was applied in a value 
survey among employees, a workshop with the management level and employee interviews, 
which ultimately synthesized into a specific list of atempo values.  
Overall 26 per cent of the company staff took part in one of these steps. Its application 
shows how participants identify and interpret the emergent values of their own company 
stories. In the case of atempo a very coherent value picture emerged, which revealed that 
the value orientations of the management level are mostly in line with the ones of the 
employees. The result was a list of 12 atempo values—self-determination, equality, respect, 
openness, self-confidence, tolerance, team spirit, love, inclusion, self-development, vision, 
empowerment—that revolve around atempo’s main goal of equality. Interestingly this list 
contains no traditional competition values.  
The missing of competition values in the case of atempo raises the question, if they are 
simply not important to the staff or if this is only a result of the research approach. Future 
research could explore this question, as well as compare values of social enterprises from 
different sectors to the ones of conventional business organizations focusing on a single

bottom line. In this sense the thesis tried to contribute to a better understanding of the 
motivation of social entrepreneurs and their employees, which again is based on the 
question, how we can direct society towards a more sustainable trajectory. Eventually the 
field of social entrepreneurship also offers an intriguing opportunity for science to develop a 
new rationality regarding its research methods. The applied methodology tried to achieve 
this, by defining values as emergent phenomena of the relational dynamics within an 
organisation, thereby offering an alternative to classical value survey approaches.

Innovative business models for industrial 
symbiosis of biomass by-products

Abstract 
To meet the requirements of a more environmentally friendly development, new business 
concepts such as industrial symbiosis (IS) are emerging (Mentink 2014). Through the 
integration of material and energy flows, IS systems become more effective and the use of 
scarce resources and discharge of pollutants is reduced (Mirata and Emtairah 2005; Wolf et 
al. 2005). However, the current body of research focuses primarily on material inputs and 
outputs and not as much on the social organizational structure for achieving IS. To realise 
this transformation, traditional business models (BMs) need to be reinvented (Mentink 
2014). This paper aims to analyse how commonly used BMs can be adapted for 
incorporating IS of biomass by-products.  
The main research questions are:  
 What is industrial symbiosis and how can business models incorporate this 
approach?  
 What are innovative business models for industrial symbiosis of biomass by-
products?  
The first question will be answered by conducting a literature review, while the second 
question will evaluate existing literature and selected case studies documenting examples of 
successfully adapted business models for the use of biomass by-products. This paper 
endeavours to contribute to the scientific debate by discussing the possibility of creating 
specific business models for IS. This form of conceptualization can assist researchers in 
analysing IS networks and can help businesses adapt or create their business model to seize 
the many opportunities that IS offers. 
As one of the most widely used tools for BM generation, Osterwalder’s (2004) Business 
Model Canvas (BMC) was chosen for the creation of innovative BMs incorporating IS of 
biomass by-products. Bocken and Short’s (2013, 2016) BM archetype “creating value from 
‘waste’” was selected and applied to Osterwalder’s BMC with specific focus on the business

value proposition, value creation and value capture. By analysing in detail the business logic 
behind one of the UK’s largest sugar producers, British Sugar, a BMC for IS of biomass by-
products from raw beet sugar production was developed. British Sugar integrated IS in every 
section of its BM and developed a wide range of synergistic and profitable product lines 
from its waste streams and by-products like electricity, bioethanol, tomatoes and animal 
feed (Short et al. 2014, 603). Lastly, the limitations of the BMC as business development tool 
were discussed and adaptations were made to increase its suitability for sustainable BMs. A 
sustainable IS BMC was created that incorporates an environmental and societal value 
proposition, a stakeholder perspective as well as an additional section for generating value 
from waste and by-products. In addition, a version of a shared BM for a network of IS 
companies, as in a business park, was developed. This augmented BMC emphasises the 
collaboration between the various network partners as well as the environmental and 
economic benefits from generating value from waste streams and by-products. In order for 
IS businesses to truly be sustainable, sustainability has to be a core part of the BM and a 
source of competitive advantage (Bocken and Short 2016, 46). This is important for changing 
the way companies define, create, deliver and capture value.

Abstract 
In a modern age where sustainability has become an issue at the forefront of our 
consciousness, there exists an ever-growing need for responsible consumption/lifestyle 
options. New businesses aiming at facilitating a consumer switch to sustainable lifestyles are 
presented with a fundamental challenge of changing the way the consumer behaves. This 
paper examines and presents measures for environmentally-focused businesses to facilitate 
effective behavioural change of the target demographic in favour of sustainability. The 
research is based on business model revision and its assessment with a specific focus on 
behavioural change. 
First, an adapted business model canvas was developed to encompass the additional 
facets of environmentally-oriented companies. This was achieved by synthesising existing 
versions of business models for sustainability (Joyce et al. 2015; Upward & Jones 2016) and 
the traditional business model canvas from (Osterwalder & Pigneur 2010). The resulting 
business model canvas includes the environmental and social dimensions in the value 
proposition. It further suggests to separately address impacts and benefits for society and 
the environment. 
Six semi-structured interviews with young sustainable enterprises, developing solutions 
for waste reduction, prevention and recycling were conducted. The interviews were 
transcribed and analysed using the qualitative content analysis method from Mayring 
(2014). The consequent data was then used to fill out the respective blocks of the adapted 
business model canvases to provide a comprehensive overview of all processes and activities 
within each startup.

To address the behavioural change aspects of the research inquiry, a model combining 
the perspectives of behavioural science and marketing was deductively drafted from the 
literature (Fogg 2009; Koene et al. 2014; Ölander & Thogersen 1995). This model pictures 
categories necessary to address in order to maximize the likelihood of the target behaviour 
taking place. Reviewing business models through the lens of the behavioural change model, 
enables the authors and the entrepreneurs eventually, to spot gaps and point out good 
practices. The model should ultimately help to better understand the process of internalizing 
new behaviours and creating new habits to finally facilitate the transition towards 
sustainable lifestyles.  
The collected data have shown that the knowledge about the aspects of behavioural 
change among the start-up entrepreneurs is rather low. The results imply that the most 
effort is dedicated to sparking interest of the customer and making the product desirable. 
Very little thoughts however, are given to the aspect of how to establish structures for a 
long-term behavioural change. Finally, the presented approach offers guidance on how to 
better incorporate motivators, triggers and reduce barriers for behavioural change into 
business models. An overview of possibilities how to address each and every category in the 
behaviour model as well as implications for persuasive business models are summarized at 
the end of the paper. Ultimately, supporting sustainable enterprises to better address the 
issues of behavioural change is an important predisposition for a larger socio-ecological 
transformation.

Abstract 
One of the greatest challenges in entrepreneurship education is to impart profound, but at 
the same time highly contemporary knowledge to the students. It aims to prepare them for 
a demanding work environment in the field of entrepreneurship that is rapidly changing, due 
to a constant development of new business models. As Bae et al. (2014) stated, 
entrepreneurship education can increase the willingness to start an new company, for which 
the awareness of new business models is essential, but even for existing companies, 
understanding new business models is important to remain competitive (Chesbrough 2010). 
Edelman et al. (2008) however, found a great discrepancy between the content of 
entrepreneurship teaching and the actions that entrepreneurs practice in reality. Lecturers 
in this field are especially prone to the issues of content actuality and practical relevance but 
research shows that even small changes in the teaching content can have a significant 
positive effect on the students’ entrepreneurship awareness (Edelman et al. 2008). In this 
study, focus is set on the application of new business models in entrepreneurship education. 
The paper aims to find out how students respond to new business models by applying them 
in the situation of starting a business, and how this behavior has changed over the past 5 
years. A database of more than 380 business plans was accessed and used to detect possible 
trends. The business plans were created during the last 10 semesters of an entrepreneurship 
class, in which students were encouraged to create a fictitious startup company and 
developed business strategies that were supposed to have a realistic chance for 
implementation. In the course of this study, business plans were analyzed by the authors 
with regard to e.g. the type of business model, the industry or the constellation of the 
founding team. A point system, based on the five sections of the Business Model Canvas 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
183 
(Osterwalder/Pigneur 2010), was introduced to rate the degree of “newness” of a business 
plan’s underlying business model. Each sample could score at a range from zero to five 
points depending on how many of the sections were considered new and innovative. 
Preliminary results show an unsteady increase in new business model-application over the 
investigated period with an almost equal distribution among male and female students. 
Team size had no significant effect but interestingly, the legal form of the fictional 
companies’ did. Results further show great differences in the innovativeness between the 
five sections of the Business Model Canvas and an increase in the application of specific 
business model types like sustainability concepts. Evaluating business plans, which were 
developed under great freedom of design, provides a direct and unbiased insight on the 
actual needs of young academics and can serve to improve actuality and quality of 
entrepreneurship education. If, for example, a significant increase of e-commerce startups is 
observed, education in online marketing and internet law can be intensified. The subject is 
of special relevance because whether students decide to found a business one day, or aim to 
work in a management position, they will greatly benefit from understanding their own 
business model as well as their competitors’. This study is expected to make a major 
contribution to improve entrepreneurship education in this regard. Its results will further be 
used to set up a more comprehensive panel study, which will also contain before and after 
course evaluation processes in the future.

Business Model, Integrated Reporting, Qualitative Research, Quality of Reports, IIRC 
Abstract 
Integrated reporting is a relatively recent phenomenon, since its official framework was 
launched late 2013. One of its key originalities is about the introduction of the "business 
model" as a new rubric to introduce in reports. After a first year of adaptation and 
preparation, some first new reports have been published in France. Based on our knowledge 
of this country and economy, our research tries to assess two points. Firstly, we wonder if 
companies really apply the official framework, settled by the IIRC (International Integrated 
Reporting Council), about the "business model" rubric. We suspect that some companies 
might be reluctant for such a new exercice of transparency. Secondly, we wonder if IIRC's 
requirements are precise enough to enforce reports, and business model explanations, of 
high quality. Our sample is composed of 15 listed companies, from different sectors. Based 
on a qualitative analysis, we first assess the quality of reports, looking at the form of 
information (graphical, narrative, quantitative, monetary). We then check the quantity of 
indicated boxes, based on the classical CANVAS model. Our empirical results show on 
average score of 21 points out of 100 for the quality, with few scores higher than 30 points, 
and only one company reaching a maximum of 45. Scores of quantity show a better picture 
with a minimum of 33 points, and an average of 64 of 100 points. These two dimensions are 
also uncorrelated. Quite strangely, only a third of French companies announce at the 
beginning of their report that they will present their business model, and then two thirds 
finally devote some space for developments and explanations about it. Only two companies 
out of 15, which means less than 15% of our sample, publish informations in all of the four 
analysed formats (graphical, narrative, quantitative, monetary). We also noticed that only 
one company was talking about "value proposition", which is in principle, a key concept and 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
186 
element of a business model. We then raise some doubts about the quality of such reports, 
and confirm our initial hypothesis about the probability that companies might be reluctant 
to explain their business model. These first results need to be more detailed and explored. 
At this stage, it remains difficult to understand why companies do not publish clear 
informations. Another reason could be their lack of habit and practice in this area. Such an 
alternative phenomenon could then demonstrate the interest of developping integrated 
thinking, through the implementation of integrated reporting. Anyway, one could wonder 
how such big companies could ignore the key elements of their business model, and also key 
models in this area in order to present themselves. Another clue is given by the only one 
company making a reference to the "value proposition" concept (Schneider Electric), 
without giving any more details about it. This means that the concept is known, but used 
with a low level of information and transparency. Few companies are also able to develop 
the level of circularity of their business model, and how their value creation strategy might 
be new and sustainable in the long term. Again, only one company (Engie) mentions the 
expression of "new business model", in reference to circular economy and the CSR Europe 
network promoting inclusive practices in direction of low-income communities. Another 
company, Danone, quite well-known in France for its CSR engagement, also develops a 
limited project with an inclusive philosophy, without being a general corporate management 
policy. We finally conclude about the inconsistencies of the IIRC's framework and reporting 
standard, in order to get precise information about the business model of a company, and 
the way its strategy and outcomes might contribute to public good, and an enhancement in 
social and environmental welfares.

Sustainable finance: 
 A new share-trade model using virtual currencies

Abstract 
Sustainability is increasingly recognized as a pressing problem facing the modern world. 
Business models and practices which fueled economic development for decades are 
increasingly seen as antiquated and exacerbating, rather than mitigating, problems and 
challenges which our economies, societies and environment face. Addressing these 
challenges requires vision, tools, technologies, and financing.  
Growing social and political demands with regard to sustainability force businesses to 
embrace the idea of multiple, i.e. financial, social and ecological, aspects of value. New 
Business Models addressing these principles emerge, supported by technological advances. 
Businesses are experimenting with and developing new organizational forms, involving 
customers in innovation and value creation processes, developing sensitivity to ecological 
issues. New patterns of organizing value creation and value sharing gradually emerge 
(Jonker, 2012).  
An aspect of sustainability which attracted limited interest is financial sustainability. For 
many authors (e.g. Chouinard et al. 2011) and professional associations (e.g. Swiss 
Sustainable Finance), sustainable finance comes down to sustainable investing, that is 
integrating social, environmental (and usually governance) criteria in investment decisions. 
In this paper, a new, broader definition of sustainable finance is proposed. The concept of 
sustainable finance should not be constrained to the idea of  financing projects and 
organizations promoting sustainability in its various aspects. It should also encompass 
developing financial sector structure and institutions that ensure fair distribution and 
efficient allocation of resources at low cost. Thus, the definition should be expanded to 
include also business models of  financial institutions and the arrangement and relations 
between business models comprising financial sector.  

 
NBM@Graz2017

The scope of the paper is limited to the stock market. Its aim is twofold. First, it is to 
develop the concept of sustainable finance in its latter aspect. The second one is to apply the 
concept to the archetypal business model of stock exchanges, currently dominating the 
stock markets, and to emergent, potentially disruptive business models based on blockchain 
and virtual currency technologies. A case study of a German startup developing a platform 
with the aim of bridging virtual currency and equity will be discussed in more detail.  
It is found that two types of products that are created on stock exchanges –  information 
and liquidity. Both of them are produced by investors who trade shares driven by their 
individual profit maximization functions, with the resulting increased liquidity and price 
informativeness being by-products of the trade. Stock exchanges only co-create these 
products by means of coordination of trades (bringing buyers and sellers together). Both 
increased liquidity and price informativeness are, however, of value to all parties involved, 
including also platform operators (stock exchanges) and even societies at large as they have 
highly positive economic consequences, including reduced cost of capital for listed 
companies and more efficient allocation of resources. Stock exchanges can thus be seen as a 
natural environment for the New Business Models. 
The recent pronounced trend of “de-equitization” (Farrell 2017) means that the role of 
stock exchanges is changing and their business model gets under increased pressure. The 
new entrants, including the one analyzed in the case study, can expand the market by 
dramatically reducing costs thanks to disintermediation and by “democratizing” finance. By 
that means, they can make finance more sustainable.

Abstract 
The IIRC is a new international standard setter for corporate reports which might become 
adopted. In order to achieve such a result, companies have to follow requirements which 
have been detailed in a clear and public document, entitled : "The International <IR> 
Framework" (2013). One of the key and new elements that has to be documented is the 
business model. Unfortunately, the IIRC has not defined what should be or could be a new 
business model, but a definition of a what should be disclosed about a business model is 
provided. One can read as follows : " An organization’s business model is its system of 
transforming inputs, through its business activities, into outputs and outcomes that aims to 
fulfil the organization’s strategic purposes and create value over the short, medium and long 
term. An integrated report describes the business model, including key: Inputs, Business 
activities, Outputs, Outcomes." We then question the quality of such a definition, making the 
hypothesis that the IIRC could have chosen a too narrow view, or a non exhaustive concept, 
of what a business model should be. In order to check our hypothesis, we have constituted 
from the EBSCO (Business Source Premier) database a sample of academic definitions found 
in 72 academic articles, responding to the three following research criteria : having "business 
model" or "business models" in their title, abstract and key-words. After a fine analysis of all 
articles, 103 definitions of 55 first authors have been found and extracted. This corpus or 
textual dataset has been applied within a lexical analysis software, known as ALCESTE and 
based on the statistical methodological developed by Reinert. This software has also an 
open-source version, entitled IRAMUTEQ, developed by Ratinaud. Hence, these two 
softwares have been used on the same dataset, making possible comparisons between

empirical results. In few words, ALCESTE or IRMUTEQ are able to detect co-occurrent words 
or lexical forms, which means terms that are fluently used together within a same unit, here 
something close to the grammatical structure of a sentence. Clusters of words are then 
proposed, providing some closed form that could be a theme. Empirical results show, after 
two different tests in ALCESTE and one with IRAMUTEQ, that some authors appear to have 
provided key and original definitions of what could be a business model. We keep authors 
that have been selected and considered to be significantly connected to clusters at a 
minimum of two times. 13 academic definitions are hence selected. After an analysis of 
previous clusters, three families of definitions are found within these 13 definitions : (1) the 
first one is called "structuralist", based on a structure and framework proposition, (2) the 
second one is called "suggestive", giving no guide and asking for reasons explaining how the 
company makes money, (3) the third one is interactive or process-oriented, making the 
assumption that a business model is a continuous process, based on the evolution of 
strategy with a permanent dialogue with stakeholders. We then used IRAMUTEQ with these 
13 definitions, tagged by one of these three families, and the text of the IIRC, found to 
belong  in spirit to the structuralist view. The empirical results show two different clusters, 
making the distinction between the suggestive and interactive views, and the structuralist 
view significantly related, from a statistical point of view, with pieces of the IIRC's text. The 
empirical and text analysis results show that the IIRC has discarded two important families of 
definitions, which might have an impact in the quality of integrated reports. The suggested 
family should also certainly amended, with a broader view of value creation, in order to 
integrate social and environmental values, and the "true earnings" concept recently tested 
by KPMG. The third family of definitions also shows that providing a framework in advance 
could also sterilize the originality of the proposition, and keep the company more far away 
from new experiments like inclusive models. Being structuralist might let you be less 
adaptative, and openminded to exchanges with external stakeholders. We also call for a 
deeper and more complete view of a "business model" definition, in order to enhance the 
future quality of integrated reports.

Presentation of the Reporting 3.0 Blueprint 
Work Ecosystem 
Ralph Thurm, OnCommons/Reporting 3.0 
ralph.thurm@kpnmail.nl 
Abstract 
Reporting 3.0 is a network of ‚positive mavericks’ that exists since 2012. After 3 years of 
conferencing (2013-2015) in order to shape the potential design of new reporting and 
disclosure that truly serves the green, inclusive and open economy on a global scale, 
Reporting 3.0 introduced the Blueprint Projects work ecosystem in which 4 projects on 
future reporting, changes in accounting, a new data architecture and a new business models 
information requirements have been given shape. Released at the end of May 2017 at the 
4th International Reporting 3.0 Conference in Amsterdam the Reporting and Data Blueprint 
are now available in Version 1, while the Accounting Blueprint has been discussed in draft 
format and the New Business Model Blueprint was just kicked off. This is a great coincidence 
with the NBM conference to present the Reporting 3.0 work ecosystem. Reporting 3.0 also 
starts an 'Academic Alliance', offering possibilities to engage with Reporting 3.0 in the 
further research, development, testing and training activities. The presentation will mainly 
give an overview about Reporting 3.0, will present the four blueprints, and will discuss 
engagement opportunities, so that participants have a rounded up first glance into how they 
could benefit from Reporting 3.0. Downloads of the existing Blueprints are available at 
www.2017.reporting3.org.

Abstract  
In this paper we develop a scale-based typology that aids in distinguishing between 
business-as-usual (BAU) (linear) business models, business models with circular aspects or 
elements and circular business models (CBMs). With this, we seek to bring clarity to the 
academic debate around CBMs and support practitioners to assess which CBMs are likely to 
have small versus transformational impacts. 
Introduction 
In this paper we develop a scale-based typology that aids in distinguishing between 
business-as-usual (BAU) (linear) business models, business models with circular aspects or 
elements and circular business models (CBMs). With this, we seek to bring clarity to the 
academic debate around CBMs and support practitioners to assess which CBMs are likely to 
have small versus transformational impacts. 
This paper addresses the need for conceptual clarity, as what does or does not 
constitute a CBM remains unclear. This lack of clarity is largely attributable to the plethora of 
ways of framing both circular economy (CE) (see Brennan et al. (2015); Blomsma and 
Brennan (2017) and Geissdoerfer et al. (2017) for overviews) and subsequently CBMs. CBMs 
are often conceptualised as ranging from, but not limited to, “creating value from waste” 
value propositions (Bocken et al. (2014); Lewandowski, 2016); or closed-loop supply chains 
(CLSC) (e.g. Guide & Van Wassenhove, 2009; Morana and Seuring, 2011; Govindan et al., 
2014;); or product service systems (PSS) (e.g. Stahel, 1984; Tukker, 2004).  Yet, each of these 
concepts illustrates different ways of operationalising CE.  
For example, the “creating value from waste” archetype limits the scope of CE to the 
level of substances or by-product exchanges. In contrast, CLSC emphasises how forward and 
reverse logistics can enable the utilization of return flows, whether products or materials. In 
comparison, PSS predominantly emphasises product or service design and shift from selling 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
197 
a product to selling a service. However, these concepts represent a spectrum themselves, 
rather than a singular model, each with different outcomes - for example Wells & Seitz 
(2005) distinguish between four types of CLSCs and Tukker (2004) eight different types of 
PSS. Questions remain regarding the degree to which these models overlap (Linder & 
Walliander, 2017) and their comparative impact. 
The associated conceptual confusion makes it difficult to distinguish between BAU 
practices and CBMs with transformative capacity. As such it can detract from what could 
have been an investment in business models which underpin the circular economy’s 
transformative capacity and even lead to circular washing. Circular-washing is when 
business-as-usual activities are rebranded as circular, for example the implementation of 
singular low-hanging circular strategies, which can lend itself to deliberate mis-framing of 
initiatives beyond their true impact. 
Methodology 
To explore the question of what makes a circular business model circular, we conduct a 
systematic literature review and examine a number of archetypal cases. We start from the 
definition of CE as an umbrella concept relating to strategies which keep resources in 
productive use for longer (Blomsma & Brennan, 2017). That is: we define the CE concept as 
one that highlights the ability of a range of waste and resource management practices to 
extend the productive life of resources and asks what combination of these strategies should 
be implemented under what circumstances (ibid). We refer to these strategies as resource 
life-extending strategies (RLES) (ibid).  
The concept of a business model can be applied at multiple levels. For example business 
models are used to describe the value creation rationale for a single product, firm or 
particular value network or supply-chain (Breuer and Lüdeke-Freund, 2014; Lüdeke-Freund 
et al. 2016). In this paper we explore product level and firm centric business models.  
Similarly to business models, the concepts of circular economy and circularity can be applied 
at different system levels. To clarify distinctions between levels of circularity we develop a 
scale based typology which illustrates key differences between linear or BAU business 
models, linear business models with circular elements and circular business models which 
have radical transformative potential. This framework is then used to compare and contrast 
archetypal cases (e.g. Kalundborg, British Sugar, Patagonia, Interface, Xerox etc.) which 
demonstrate how CBMs can be clustered along a spectrum. 
To interrogate the extant academic literature which informs the development of our 
scale based typology of CBMs we adopt systematic literature review (SLR) as a ‘guiding tool’ 
(Tranfield et al. 2003; Wang and Chugh, 2014). Following Tranfield et al. (2003), SLR’s seek to 
develop rigorous and replicable review processes. These begin with a scoping study, to 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
198 
inform the creation of a research protocol which includes the identification of inclusion and 
exclusion criteria and key term search strings. This process is informed by feedback of 
experts, both academic and practitioner, in the chosen subject.  
We time-bound our literature review to 1985-2017 due to the fact that while 
antecedents of the circular economy can be traced back to 1800’s (Brennan et al., 2015), 
findings from previous work by the authors (Blomsma and Brennan, 2017) demonstrate that 
the circular economy as an umbrella concept emerges around 1985. Moreover, the business 
model concept is regarded as becoming prevalent with the rise of the Internet in the mid-
1990s (Zott et al. 2011) and thus this literature is also covered by our selected time range.    
An additional boundary criterion of our review is our focus solely on circularity rather 
than sustainable business models more generally. While we acknowledge that the 
relationship between circular business models and sustainable business models is contested 
and often blurred within the extant literature (e.g. Lewandowski, 2016) unpacking the 
relationship between these two concepts is outside the scope of this review1.  Aligning with 
convention, we limit our SLR to solely peer-reviewed literature from ABS journals ranked 3* 
and above to ensure the quality of literature included in this review. However, as the circular 
economy discourse is emerging from academia and practice (Brennan and Blomsma, 2017) 
we also intend to include in our discussion selected peer-reviewed literature from lower 
ranking journals and grey literature as a means of sense-checking our findings.  
The selection of our archetypal cases (e.g. Kalundborg, British Sugar, Patagonia, 
Interface, Xerox etc) is based on the frequency of how often these cases are mentioned as 
exemplars within the academic and grey literature combined with the availability of 
longitudinal data related to the selected organisations’ business models associated with 
RLES.  
Preliminary Findings & Conclusion 
Our scoping study illustrates that in addition to the use of the terms “circular economy 
business models” or “circular business models” there are also a range of broadly 
synonymous terms used by different scholars and practitioners. These include: “closed-loop 
economy business models”, “closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) business models”, 
“remanufacturing business models”, “resource efficient business models”, “cradle-to-cradle 
business models” and “product-service system or service-based business models”.   
While at the preliminary stages our research suggests that although many business models 
may enable keeping resources in productive use for longer these business models can be 
clustered across a spectrum of impact - ranging from small to transformational. This finding 
reiterates the importance of considering the outcomes that a particular business model can 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
199 
create in a particular context, e.g. sector, geography or scale, when seeking to distinguish 
and invest in business models which can contribute to transformational impact. Therefore, 
we propose defining a CBM as - a business model which captures value from the capacity of 
RLES in different circular configurations - acknowledging that different CBMs have different 
outcomes, creating different types (environmental, economic and social), and scales of 
value. 
This paper is presented at NBM2017 as a developmental paper as the research is ongoing. 
We seek to use the conference as a forum to sense-check the preliminary findings from the 
scoping study and development of the research protocol which inform our scale-based 
typology of CBMs.

Zero-Marginal Cost Economy 
Abstract 
A new economic paradigm entitled “Sharing Economy” (SE) has emerged with the growth of 
sharing assets by using information technology and digital platforms based on more 
collaborative forms of consumption. Cost structure strongly differs in SE compared with 
traditional companies, as collaborative rather than capitalistic approach is about shared 
access rather than private ownership. Millions of people are using various digital platforms 
like websites and mobile Apps in a network community to share assets like home, car, 
knowledge, space, money and other items at low or near zero marginal cost. For this reason, 
companies in the SE steal clients, value and profit from traditional capitalist companies. In 
this sense, it is worth analysing what the innovations at business model level are that 
companies from SE do. So, the main purpose of this study is to shed light on the effect of the 
four main pillars of Sharing Economy (namely Digital platforms that connect spare capacity 
and demand, Transactions that offer access over ownership, More collaborative and trust-
based forms of consumption, and Branded experiences that drive emotional connection) on 
each of the Business Model elements of a company suggested in the Osterwalder’s business 
model canvas. A number of companies active in the Sharing Economy environment in the 
fields of transportation, accommodation and finance are selected and the required 
information for building their business model is acquired through conducting a content 
analysis, and a benchmarking process is done. The effect of each of the Sharing Economy 
pillars on each Business Model element is studied for all selected companies and a heat 
map, showing the concentration of the companies on each element in the SE environment is 
provided. As a result of analysing the heat map, some hints are provided for the companies 
to help them make an innovation in the Business Model, which are valuable for researchers 
involved in Business Model Innovation.

Introduction 
A new economic phenomenon is taking place over the last years and traditional capitalist 
companies have been defied by a new set of companies which are operated from sharing or 
collaborative economy. For example Airbnb in accommodation sector, Uber or Lyft in 
transportation sector and Funding Circle in finance or banking sector have disrupted the 
businesses of traditional capitalist companies in travel and hotel industry, mobility industry 
and banking industry, respectively. They do so with new business models that strongly rely 
on the active use of information technology and trust between users among other 
characteristics. Those new business models allow for new more effective cost structures 
being able to grant lower prices for customers. 
This is the corner stone of the new economic paradigm as described by Rifkin (2015) in 
“zero marginal cost society”, how the emerging Internet of Things is speeding us to an era of 
nearly free goods and services, precipitating the meteoric rise of a global Collaborative 
Commons and the eclipse of capitalism. Innovation in the business model of the companies 
is a major key to their success in a sharing economy nvironment. Non-ownership, temporary 
access, and redistribution of material goods or less tangible assets are the main 
characteristics of such an environment (Kathan, Matzler & Veider, 2016). Therefore, realizing 
the effects of Sharing Economy on different elements of the BM can help companies to get 
ideas how to make an innovation in their business models to improve their competitive 
position. 
In this study, a few famous and successful companies active in the SE environment in 
transportation, accommodation and finance fields are selected and the effect of the core 
pillars of the SE introduced by PricewaterhouseCoopers  (PwC) (Trunkfield, 2015; Atkinson, 
2015) on each of their BM elements based on the Osterwalder’s business model canvas 
(2010) are studied. Based on the analysis conducted using a heat map comprising of SE 
pillars and BM elements, some hints are provided for the companies to make an innovation 
in their business model.  
The remaining parts of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the theoretical 
backgrounds of the SE and BM as well as a brief explanation regarding the SE core pillars and 
BM elements are provided. The methodology applied in this study is discussed in section 3 
and is followed by results and discussion in the next section. In the final section, the 
conclusions of the research are summarized. 
Theoretical Background 
The name “Sharing Economy” (SE) may be interpreted under different labels. Examples of 
the different interpretations currently interconnected to the concept of sharing economy 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
203 
include collaborative consumption, collaborative economy, on-demand economy, peer-to-
peer economy, zero-marginal cost economy, and crowd-based capitalism (Selloni, 2017). The 
first appearance of the term “Sharing Economy” in the Oxford Dictionaries was in 2015, and 
its transformation into a popular buzz word happened since the publication of a book by 
Botsman and Rogers (2010) regarding the rise of collaborative consumption (Hern, 2015; 
The Economist, 2013). In the SE, information technology is utilized to make connections 
between dispersed groups of people and companies and provide them the opportunity to 
share access instead of ownership, so that they can make better use of goods, skills, 
services, capital and spaces. 
Sharing Economy is distinguished by the following four core pillars (Trunkfield, 2015; 
Atkinson, 2015), which are also considered in the analysis conducted in this paper. 
Digital platforms that connect spare capacity and demand: The blossoming of 
businesses in the SE are powered by technology platforms, through which the businesses are 
able to connect the available spare capacity and demand fast and dynamically. 
Transactions that offer access over ownership: One common aspect in all companies 
working in SE is that while providing more options for the customers, they reduce costs of 
ownership. Therefore, what is considered here it is to give an access to a product, not 
necessarily transferring its ownership, and SE provides the possibility to “access” over 
“ownership”. 
More collaborative and trust-based forms of consumption: Nowadays, people are 
gradually taking some distance from the traditional forms of transactions and are more 
willing to engage in transactions which involve deeper social interactions. It is stated that 
63% of the American adults who are familiar with SE, believe that engaging in an SE 
transaction is more fun compared with the traditional companies (Atkinson, 2015). 
Branded experiences that drive emotional connection: The social connection a brand 
builds has become a major parameter for the value it obtains. Making such social and 
emotional connections with customers in the SE can mainly be achieved through experience 
designs, which provide more sense of friendship for the customers. 
In spite of the wide spectrum of practices in SE in today’s markets, there is a limited 
practical knowledge about how businesses involved in the SE should design their business 
models in order to be successful. Therefore, to find out key elements in the business model 
of a company, which are more eligible to accept an innovation and help the companies 
survive in the current competitive environment, an analysis, taking both SE and BM 
elements into account, seems to be useful in this regard.

There are a lot of definitions for Business Model presented by scholars, among which, 
could be the defining a Business Model as a tool for business planning that helps managers 
understand and describe the business logic of their firm (Osterwalder, 2004), as an 
organization’s core logic for creating value (Linder & Cantrell, 2000), or as a description of a 
complex business that enables the study of its structure, of the relationships among 
structural elements, and of how it will respond to the real world (Petrovic, Kittl et al. , 2001; 
Applegate, 2001). Also, Weill and Vitale (2001) define a business model as a description of 
the roles and relationships among consumers, customers, allies and suppliers of an 
organization, which identifies the major flows of product, information, and money, as well as 
the major benefits to participants. In fact, all these definitions commonly agree that business 
model means how a company can work and make money. For the purpose of this study a 
business model is defined as “the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and 
captures value”, which is a famous definition provided by Osterwalder and Pigneur (2010).  
According to Osterwalder (2004), the first step to make business models is to define of 
what elements business models are composed. The nine elements in the Osterwalder’s 
business model canvas (2010), which are used in this paper are listed in Table 1. These nine 
building blocks cover the four main areas of a business: customers, offer, infrastructure and 
financial viability.

BM Elements 
Definition 
Infrastructure 
Key Partners 
2The key partnerships building block describes the network of suppliers and 
partners that make the business model work. Companies forge partnerships for 
many reasons, and partnerships are becoming a cornerstone of many business 
models. Companies create alliances to optimize their business models, reduce 
risk, or acquire resources. 
Key Activities 
The key activities building block describes the most important things a company 
must do to make its business model work. These are the most important actions a 
company must take to operate successfully. 
Key Resources 
The key resources building block describes the most important assets required to 
make a business model work. These resources allow an enterprise to create and 
offer a value proposition, reach markets, maintain relationships with customer 
segments, and earn revenues. 
Offer 
Value 
Proposition 
The value propositions building block describes the bundle of products and 
services that create value for a specific customer segment. The value proposition 
is the reason why customers turn to one company over another. It solves a 
customer problem or satisfies a customer need. 
Customer 
Customer 
Relationships 
The customer relationships building block describes the types of relationships a 
company establishes with specific customer segments. A company should clarify 
the type of relationship it wants to establish with each customer segment. 
Channels 
The channels building block describes how a company communicates with and 
reaches its Customer segments to deliver a value proposition. 
Customer 
Segments 
The customer segments building block defines the different groups of people or 
organizations an enterprise aims to reach and serve. In order to better satisfy 
customers, a company may group them into distinct segments with common 
needs, common behaviours, or other attributes. 
Financial 
viability 
Cost Structure 
The cost structure describes all costs incurred to operate a business model. This 
building block describes the most important costs incurred while operating under 
a particular business model. Creating and delivering value, maintaining customer 
relationships, and generating revenue all incur costs. 
Revenue 
Streams 
The revenue streams building block represents the cash a company generates 
from each customer segment (costs must be subtracted from revenues to create 
earnings). If customers comprise the heart of a business model, revenue streams 
are its arteries. 
 
In addition to what stated about BM, Business model innovation (BMI), which is defined 
by Zhao, Pan and Lu (2016) as a pursuing novel form of value creation and capturing 
mechanism, is increasingly becoming a priority for managers in terms of creating 
competitive advantage and achieving superior performance. In fact, BMI refers to making 
changes to the activity system of the organization (Zott & Amit, 2010), the “design of 
organizational structures to enact a commercial opportunity” (George & Bock, 2011, p. 99), 
or the element which inks innovation to value creation (Chesbrough & Rosenbloom, 2002), 
that translates technical innovation into commercial performance (Teece, 2010). 
The effect of different pillars of the sharing economy on each of the nine elements of 
business model mentioned is studied and discussed in section four of this paper. This can

help companies to better decide in which parts of the business model to make an 
innovation, in order to succeed in today’s competitive environment. 
Methodology 
For the purpose of this research, a list of companies active in the SE are gathered and 7 
companies active in transportation, accommodation and finance fields are selected. These 
companies are listed in Table 2. Secondary information is used as an input for content 
analysis. Using the information obtained, the business model canvas of each company is 
obtained and used for benchmarking. 
In the next step, a heat map is designed, using the 4 core pillars of the SE in one side and 
the nine BM elements introduced in the Osterwalder’s business model canvas in the other. 
Heat map is known to be a graphical representation of data in which colors are used instead 
of the individual numbers in each cell of the matrix. Based on the information and BMs 
provided in the previous step, the effect of each pillar on each BM element is investigated 
and each of the cells in the matrix gets a weight accordingly. A range of colors from light red 
to dark red is used to show the intensity of the concentration of the selected companies in 
each considered cell, from low to high. 
Finally, based on the heat map constructed, analysis are given and suggestions are 
provided for BMI in companies in section 4 and 5 of the paper.

Results and discussion 
Putting the nine BM elements on one dimension of the matrix and the four SE pillars on the 
other, the following heat map (Table 3) is derived from studying the 7 selected companies. 
To classify the information and give a more clear view, the BM elements are put into 4 main 
areas, which Osterwalder (2010) has identified as the areas constituting the 9 essential 
elements of a BM. These broad areas are also shown in the table. 
Analyzing this heat map, and keeping in mind the fields the companies selected are 
active in, important points are achieved. Some of these points are as follows.

If considering the pillars, “Digital platforms that connect spare capacity and demand” 
(Pillar 1) influences Key Activities, Key Resources, Value Proposition, Cost Structure and 
Channels in in all the companies studied in different fields (accommodation, transportation 
and finance). It also affects customer segments only in those companies, in which a strong 
link is created between customers through building a network; and that is the most 
attractive aspect in the decision made by the customers to join the network. In the 
companies, which are active in the field of finance, the case is somehow different as people 
and businesses deal with money. Banking system is nowadays powerful enough in terms of 
technology and IT platforms, and the electronic transactions are not of special interest for 
the customers to be attracted. Besides, this pillar does not affect those companies whose 
main resource is owned by the company itself, networking is not of that importance and the 
main customer segment consists of the ones who need to use that resource. In such 
companies, although IT can facilitate the process of using that resource, it does not seriously 
affect the customer segment. Therefore, based on the different and unique connection 
made with the customers depending on the activity field of the company, Pillar 1 can affect 
the customer segments. 
“Transactions that offer access over ownership” (Pillar 2) does not affect channel and 
customer relationship, as it mainly focuses on the service/commodity being accessed 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
209 
through sharing. However, it affects Value Proposition and Customer Segments regardless of 
the main shared service/commodity being owned by the company itself or by another party, 
who is going to share that. It also affects Key Partners, Key activities, Key resources and cost 
structure only in those companies which are an intermediary between two groups of people 
or businesses, one willing to share something with another. These companies are not the 
owner of the main service/commodity being shared. Therefore, those companies who own 
their resource to be shared, are not affected by pillar 2 in the mentioned elements of the 
BM. Besides, while pillar 2 reduces the costs of providing the main shared 
service/commodity for the studied companies (since it is provided by another group), it 
affects the revenue of those companies who are the owner of the shared services/ 
commodities.  
Whether the company owns the shared service/ commodity or not, key partners, key 
resources and value proposition are affected by “More collaborative and trust-based forms 
of consumption” (Pillar 3). Besides, the shared service/commodity being owned by the 
company determines the effect of Pillar 3 on key activities, cost structure and revenue 
stream. For those companies owning the shared service/commodity, Pillar 3 will affect only 
cost structure out of the elements mentioned. But for the ones who do not own them 
directly, Pillar 3 will affect Key Activities and revenue stream (since they have to invest less, 
but earn much more). This Pillar does not affect customer segments in those companies 
which are active in the financial field, but can affect companies which are active in 
transportation and accommodation fields and own the shared resources. It does not affect 
channel and customer relationship either, since its main focus is on the service/commodity 
being accessed through sharing. This is worth mentioning that for the companies who do not 
own the shared resource, the type of services provided and the way to provide it are key 
parameters to decide whether Pillar 3 has an effect on customer segments or not. 
“Branded experiences that drive emotional connection” (Pillar 4) does not affect key 
activities, key resources and value proposition as it mainly focuses on the emotional 
connection of the customers. It does not affect cost structure, either. Instead, it affects 
Customer Relationships, Channels, Customer Segments and the Revenue Stream resulting 
from customer attraction. In fact, in order for SE companies to be successful, they have to 
pay a high attention to their 4th pillar as it directly affects current and potential customers. A 
PwC report highlights the importance of this when stating that 69% of the US adults familiar 
with the sharing economy will not trust companies active in SE unless they are 
recommended by someone they trust (Atkinson, 2015). In addition, since one group of the 
key partners could be the ones who provide something to share (accommodation, 
transportation vehicle, money, etc.), Pillar 4 can affect those companies who are not the 
owner of the shared resources and are only a means for sharing that resource between two 
persons or businesses, regardless of their field of activity. This is highlighted in companies, in 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
210 
which the owners of the shared resource feel that they are part of a big and branded 
company. 
It worth mentioning that “Digital platforms that connect spare capacity and demand” 
and “Transactions that offer access over ownership” (Pillars 1 and 2) mainly affect the cost 
structure, and “More collaborative and trust-based forms of consumption” and “Branded 
experiences that drive emotional connection” (Pillars 3 and 4) mainly affect the revenue 
stream. There is an exception in “Transactions that offer access over ownership” and “More 
collaborative and trust-based forms of consumption” for those companies who are the 
owner of shared resources. i.e. for these companies, “Transactions that offer access over 
ownership” (Pillar 2) affects revenue stream and “More collaborative and trust-based forms 
of consumption” (Pillar 3) affects cost structure. 
This type of analysis and the results obtained can help the companies, which are active 
in SE, to concentrate more on the innovative options in their business model and also can 
help companies to realize how to make an innovation in their business model to be more 
successful in a sharing economy. 
Conclusion and implications 
Competition in the current market environment has lead companies to move towards 
finding innovative ways to increase their market share. Companies active in the Sharing 
Economy, whose number is growing in the recent years, follow the same story and finding 
ways to make an innovation in their business model to make them more successful in such a 
competitive environment, has become a concern for them. 
In this study, 4 core pillars of the SE, named “Digital platforms that connect spare 
capacity and demand”, “Transactions that offer access over ownership”, “More collaborative 
and trust-based forms of consumption” and “Branded experiences that drive emotional 
connection”, and the 9 elements in the Osterwalder’s business model canvas were analyzed 
for 7 companies in transportation, accommodation and finance fields in the SE regarding the 
mentioned pillars. 
To give a clear image of the level of effectiveness of the 4 pillars of SE on the elements 
of business model canvas, a heat map was utilized, and the selected companies were 
analyzed through using that. Results indicate that the affection of SE core pillars on the BM 
elements, may depend on the nature of the filed the company is active in, the way the 
company links the customers together, the ownership of the shared service/commodity, and 
sometimes none of them, i.e. these pillars may have 100% or no effect on some BM 
elements regardless of the mentioned criteria. Therefore, while the effect of some SE pillars 
on some BM elements specified to be zero or 100 percent, to analyze the situation of a 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
211 
company and find solutions for making an innovation in its BM, the BM of the company 
should be constructed and the effect of each SE pillar on each BM element for the remaining 
cells be analyzed considering the field of activity, networking customers and the type of 
ownership of the company. Such an analysis can help companies to find the situation they 
have comparing with their successful competitors, or to get an idea for making an innovation 
in their business model. Some novel points and hints can be obtained from such analysis to 
help companies find their blue ocean and continue their business life in a more personalized, 
successful way in today’s competitive environment. 
However, this study can be improved in the future to give more exact results as the 
number of companies to be studied can increase and the fields these companies are active 
in can be more diversified.

Introduction 
Although Aalborg, Denmark, has historically been an industrial city, such activity has been 
leaving. One of the latest examples of this is the relocation of the Aalborg Akvavit production 
to Norway. In an attempt to pay homage to the distinctive spirit produced by Aalborg 
Akvavit and its unique manufacturing facilities, its former production site will be 
transformed into Cloud City –a hub for innovation, art, technology and culture. One of the 
planned projects is the Spirit Center, a micro-distillery whose primary ambition is to 
represent and dignify the history and heritage of the Akvavit Distillery in the city. On five 
floors, the Spirit Center will hold a showroom exhibiting the spirit production, an Akvavit 
tasting area, the micro-distillery itself, a restaurant/bar and an open rooftop garden. 
Methodology 
The Cloud City project is based on the principles of sustainability, collaboration and 
innovation.  This opened an opportunity to research the potential to combine sustainable 
energy production with urban agriculture, to strive on a collaborative closed-loop system: 
the Spirit Center. Through a detailed literature review and interviews with experts and 
potential stakeholders, areas in the Spirit Center where principles of circular economy could 
be applied were explored, as it implies the principles in which the Cloud City is based.  

 
NBM@Graz2017

Background 
Aiming to develop a continuously improving sustainable production and business model, 
through innovation and collaboration the Spirit Center’s “sustainable innovation system” 
(SIS) (Kraaijenhagen et al. 2016) was designed. This was done by adopting the “partnered 
system focus” i.e., including strategies for closing, slowing and narrowing the resource loops 
and creating a network operation scheme, providing an outline for an interdependent supply 
chain. 
Since Akvavit is a consumer good, it is uncertain if the SIS approach would be enough to 
effectively transmit and pass on the increased value to the costumers. In other words, while 
the circular economy covers the value creation and capture, it is not able on itself to 
effectively communicate or deliver such value. In contrast with this, businesses using the 
experience economy approach have managed to make visible the once invisible added value 
of their products, making customers aware of the extra benefit they receive and most 
importantly, making them pay its price.  
The experience economy addresses the visitors specifically. As several stakeholders in 
the craft-spirit market mentioned during the interviews, the backstory of a product has a 
large marketing potential. Sharing the backstory through conceptual and physical 
experiences allow the customer to further understand, interact and engage in the 
production processes, material sourcing and other steps in the supply chain. This 
experienceable circular production –setup backed by a strong narrative (inspired by the 
experience economy)– allow the customers to be more aware of the sustainable practices 
behind the Spirit Center and its business values. Furthermore, given the unique historical 
importance of Akvavit to Aalborg, it enables the consumers to relate to the product, its story 
and its urban-local identity at a personal level, enhancing their willingness to pay for it. 
(Esbjerg et al. 2014; J.Y. Jang et al. 2011).  
Results & Discussion  
The Cloud City project in itself and the outlined SIS for the Spirit Center possess three 
particular elements that have been studied separately in terms of their market value. 1) 
Business sustainability (Kim, Yoon & Shin 2015). The Spirit Center is designed to co-create 
horizontally with its partners. 2) Organic materials (Sonderskov & Daugbjerg 2011). Organic 
production involves certain circular economy practices, like recirculating organic material, 
taking the circular approach off-site and reaching the value chain. 3) Hyper-locality 
(Mathews & Picton 2014). Locally sourced and consumed craft-products cut down on 
transportation needs, as well as make a case for small scale production to satisfy local 
demands. 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
215 
The relation of those three elements with the circular economy values and practices, 
and their potential to effectively deliver and capture through the experienceable circular 
production are a relevant finding of this research. Focusing on the production process, the 
use of urban farming and locally sourced raw materials contributes to resource efficiency i.e, 
narrowing the loop, while valorizing waste by converting distillation waste into biogas 
contributes to closing the resource loop. The creation of a narrative based on the elements 
previously explained is what will allow the customer to enjoy a unique experience. The 
visitors of the Spirit Center will see themselves immersed in an environment where 
sustainability values drive the business. 
Conclusion 
The Spirit Center provides an opportunity to complement the circular economy with the 
experience economy, and might be an example on how to transform industrial businesses. 
However, it still has to be studied which other production-related aspects depending on the 
industrial sector, can be used to exploit the synergy between the circular economy and the 
experience economy to achieve this transformation. Is the general set of values of the 
circular economy apt to be turned into physical and conceptual experiences? For such 
reason, this project works as a stepping stone for starting a paradigm shift of the industrial 
activity in the urban context towards a circular and experienceable business in which the 
creation of narratives can provide benefits throughout all the three dimensions of 
sustainability.

Abstract 
The shift towards the circular economy entails business model innovation as essential 
building block, therefore the understanding of barriers occurring during circular business 
model innovation is essential. This paper synthesizes barriers to business model innovation 
with barriers to circular economy derived from two literature reviews. Nine relevant barriers 
for circular business model innovation were identified, spread across micro, meso and macro 
level. Additionally 19 interdependencies between these barriers were conceptualized, 
showing the complex system of barriers companies are facing when innovating their 
business models towards the circular economy. 
Introduction 
The circular economy (CE) theoretically gives companies the chance to foster economic 
growth decoupled from resource constrains (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015; Liu et al., 
2009; Murray et al., 2015; Xue et al., 2010). The concept of the CE is receiving increasing 
attention and the need for a transition towards it is gathering momentum (Buren et al., 
2016). Business model innovation (BMI) is necessary to fully benefit from the potential of 
certain technologies or products of the CE (Hall and Wagner, 2012) and to accelerate a 
system level change (Webster, 2015). There is a growing number of research on circular 
business model innovation (CBMI), mostly resulting in frameworks and concepts 
(Lewandowski, 2016; Mentink, 2014; Antikainen and Valkokari, 2016). Nevertheless, there is 
still a lack of understanding the barriers occurring during CBMI (Xue et al., 2010) and BMI 
contains more than the mere application of academic frameworks and tools (Chesbrough, 
2010). On the other side, advanced research on ‘linear’ business model innovation already 
offers a good understanding of the barriers and challenges of BMI.

Therefore, this paper (1) applies known barriers of BMI literature to the specific context 
of the CE and (2) identifies additional barriers specific to CBMI, based on CE literature. (3) 
The paper also conceptualizes the nature of the identified barriers in the micro, meso and 
macro level and draws interdependencies between them. Understanding the barriers to 
CBMI is crucial, as in practice a discrepancy between the ambition of companies to shift 
towards the CE and actual progress can be observed.  
Methodology 
Two distinct qualitative and systematic literature reviews were conducted (Green et al., 
2006), one on barriers to BMI and one on barriers to the CE. In total 40 contributions were 
reviewed. The synthesis of the literature reviews lead to the identification of nine relevant 
barriers to CBMI. Fig. 1 outlines the systematic reviewing process.

Results and Discussion 
The two literature reviews lead to similar as well as distinct barriers and the synthesis of the 
two literature review found that the following nine barriers are relevant for the specific case 
of the CE.  
Regulatory barriers 
Regulatory barriers play an important role, restraining CBMI in two ways: (1) by a lack of 
support and (2) by too restrictive regulations. Especially the regulatory barrier mentioned by 
Stahel (2010), Rizos et al. (2016), Zhang et al. (2011) and Pan et al. (2015) of contradictory 
fiscal policy instruments links to the principle of the CE that prices should reflect real costs.  
Technological barriers 
For CBMI technological barriers are occurring when (1) necessary technologies do not yet 
exist (2) access or availability to necessary technologies is not given or (3) a lack of expertise 
or knowledge of the CE system hinders the adequate use of available technologies. 
Additionally CBMI is challenged by the spread of linear technology which can lead to lock-in 
effects (Rizos et al., 2016). Technological barriers can be located in the macro-level, for 
example when technologies do not yet exist and are dependent on the overall technological 
development, in the meso-level, when certain companies do already command technologies 
but due to competitive behaviour others cannot access them and in the micro-level, when a 
lack of resources hinders the access or adequate use of existing technology.  
Economic barriers  
A lack of capital represents a barrier for CBMI because (1) the possibility to experiment is 
limited (Sosna et al., 2010) and (2) a buffer to react to negative unforeseen events is missing 
(Bohnsack et al., 2014). Additionally there is a economic barrier due to a higher business risk 
of CBM. While the barrier of business risk is in the micro level, economic barriers are also in 
the meso-level, when a specific size is needed to be profitable in a certain market (Helms, 
2016). The macro-level also bears economic barriers, namely when economic recession 
renders access to financial capital, which is according to Rizos et al. (2016) even more 
difficult for CE propositions.  
Market barriers 
Market barriers can be separated into (1) barriers when entering existing markets and (2) 
barriers when creating novel markets. There is a high lack of market attractiveness in 
existing markets, as without the embeddedness in a CE system, single circular products 
cannot gain their full potential (Shahbazi et al., 2016; Kuokkanen et al., 2016) and the 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
224 
products do not fit the system (Johnson et al., 2008). Additionally, CE services often 
challenge prevailing practices and systems, in which established have invested in and are still 
profiting from, therefore they will not help in challenging the existing system (Bohnsack et 
al., 2014). To circumvent these challenges, novel markets can be created (Bohnsack et al., 
2014; Eichen et al., 2015). Despite representing a big challenge, creating novel market places 
for CBMI is the best way to build new systems based on the principles of the CE.  
Internal barriers 
BMI as well as CE literature mentions corporate culture as a possible barrier to change 
(Eichen et al., 2015; Shahbazi et al., 2016). Internal resistance can appear due to employee 
culture and behaviour, lack of commitment of top management or high risk reluctance 
(Matsumoto et al., 2016). For CBMI, not only change averse culture is a barrier, but also a 
linear culture. The principles of the CE should be embedded in the thinking of leadership as 
well as employees. Finding adequate talent can be a barrier. Especially as employees being 
familiar with or having work experience in a CE environment are still uncommon.  
Conflict barrier 
When a CE business model is introduced as one of several business models within a 
company, a risk of cannibalization exists (Amit and Zott, 2001). The conflicting risk may be 
even bigger than for two linear business models operating next to each other as 
manufacturers face the risk of reduced sales in one business model through offering circular 
business models, f.e. repair services (Zhang et al., 2011). Additionally, it can lead to a lack of 
credibility (Helms, 2016). The stimulus mentioned by BMI literature to explore new 
opportunities and simultaneously exploit existing capabilities (Richter, 2013; O'Reilly and 
Tushman, 2004) can be a massive barrier for circular development, as exploiting current 
capabilities hinders circular systems and possibilities. 
Cognitive barrier 
The cognitive barrier is described as a unconscious process, where irrelevant information is 
consequently filtered out (Chesbrough, 2010). A lack of knowledge about the CE also leads 
to the case that information is filtered in a wrong way, as data and information is analysed in 
a ‘linear’ way of thinking (Richter, 2013; Bohnsack et al., 2014). This can lead to a perceived 
lack of consumer demand (Prendeville et al., 2016) or a wrong application of technology 
(Case et al., 2017). To overcome the cognitive barrier of CBMI, our underlying behavioural 
model has to be changed. This starts with the spread of knowledge (Buren et al., 2016). It is 
therefore argued, that the cognitive barrier for the CE is even bigger than for normal BMI, as 
the concept and idea of the CE is not yet widely spread or even anchored in the thinking and 
therefore many possible and disruptive business opportunities are not identified.  

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
225 
Information barrier 
The authors see this barrier as a very important overarching barrier, being essential for the 
general transition to the CE. This barrier is located in the macro-level, acknowledging the 
general lack of knowledge about the CE in society. Without a further spread of knowledge 
and the idea and system of the CE, new business models will not emerge and the system 
conditions will not change towards a more favourable system for CBMI.  
Value chain barrier  
When looking at the underlying idea of the CE, the closure of resource loops as well as the 
principle of system-thinking, it becomes apparent that a well-functioning value chain is 
essential. In the linear system and when entering existing markets, partners may be 
unsupportive because of a resilience to change and protectionism. The missing awareness of 
each other’s existence constitutes a barrier to form win-win cooperation between CBM 
(Buren et al., 2016). Additionally, businesses creating value through closing the loop face a 
barrier in difficult return flows (Rizos et al., 2016).  
Spread over micro, meso and macro level, the identified barriers are mostly connected 
to each other and partially overlapping. The connections were conceptualized on the basis of 
the literature reviews and 19 interdependencies were identified, presented in Tab. 1. The 
understanding of these interdependencies is essential for the development of strategies to 
overcome the barriers, as it shows that focus on one single barrier will only partly lead to 
success. System thinking, one of the principles of the CE is essential to successfully tackle 
CBMI.

Conclusion 
Currently there is a gap in the understanding of the barriers businesses are confronted with 
when innovating towards the CE. The clear clustering of barriers and development of 
associated issues can help companies to better prioritize and utilize their resources 
(Shahbazi et al., 2016) and support their ambition to shift towards circular business models. 
This contribution makes a first attempt to identify relevant barriers to CBMI, based on BMI 
and CE literature. Nine relevant barriers were identified and it is concluded that barriers to 
CBMI are even higher than for ‘linear’ BMI, especially because the spread across meso and 
macro level and the complex interrelations between the barriers. Illustrated in Fig. 2, it 
becomes obvious that CBMI faces a complex system of interlinked barriers. Overcoming this 
interdependent system of barriers is often unfeasible for single companies. The complex 
system of barriers to CBMI therefore presents a huge challenge for the general transition to 
the CE. This contribution calls for a focus on the meso-level and how companies can 
collaboratively innovate their business models. Solution strategies could for example be 
collective engagements against meso and macro level barriers whilst innovating the 
corporate culture and micro level barriers independent from each other.    
This contribution shows that the general lack of information constitutes an important 
barrier, influencing and magnifying almost all other barriers. Tearing down this information 
related barrier as first level offense would decrease the complexity and magnitude of the 
other barriers. The metaphor of an upward spiral can be used here. The more information 
and awareness is available, the more companies are joining the CE and the easier it will get 
for others to join and innovate their business model.

This work is limited due to its conceptual boundaries set to the literature of BMI and 
CE only. Nevertheless, the authors experienced the point of satisfaction early during the 
content analysis, as insights turned asymptotic (Lincoln et al., 2011).   
Future work will need to test these theoretical derived barriers in case studies. Based 
on the testing of these barriers, solution strategies need to be developed which can inform 
regulatory interventions, business strategies, sector agendas and NGO influencing strategies. 
Here, a link to strategies applied for wicked problems in the linear system should be drawn, 
for example open innovation, as these wicked problems are also characterized by complex 
interdependencies (Head, 2008).

Abstract 
Along with the critics addressed to the industrial economic model (Du Tertre 2009), new 
economic models inspired by a more servicial way of thinking emerge. These new economic 
models, such as Functional and Cooperative Economy (FCE) seems to be more relevant 
regarding sustainable development (Benqué, du Tertre and Vuidel 2014).  
When an enterprise chooses to take the path toward a service-based economic model, 
it means changes in the way the enterprise is organised, in the way value is created and the 
way the value produced is then transformed into monetary flux. Those changes take the 
form of new kind of relationship between producers and clients whose are closely 
cooperating. This means new kind of contracts and new invoicing practices. The units chosen 
to summarize the company offers should change as well. 
Contractual issues and invoicing practices are two important dimensions in companies’ 
business models. We make a distinction in this paper between economic model – dealing 
with the way value is created – and business model – the way value is changed into 
monetary flux (Gaglio, Lauriol and du Tertre 2011). An enterprise engaged in a path toward 
new economic model should face tension about its business model as well.  
The contribution would propose an analysis of the links between economic model 
shifting and business model evolution through business cases studies.

Introduction 
The socioeconomic environment has met some deep changes in the 20th century’s last 
decades and the 21st century first one. Structural economic changes leading to enterprises 
economic model shifting issues have been identified by some authors from human and 
social sciences. Among them, Christian du Tertre identifies four main changes (du Tertre 
2009; 2013). First, the technological and digital innovations have changed the way labour is 
organized, spatially and temporally. Another structural change lies in the transition from an 
economic dynamic led by industry toward a dynamic led by services. In addition, the services 
development is simultaneous with the predominance taken by immaterial and relational 
aspects into activities, notices du Tertre. Therefore, non-tangible and non-measurable 
effects resulting from those relational and immaterial activities are getting central in today’s 
economy. At last, environmental and social issues are now well known. This calls for new 
growth models and sustainable development as defined in the Bruntland report (1987). The 
French economist concludes that all these structural changes should lead to rethink the 
conceptual framework inherited from the industrial age to develop a servicial and 
cooperative one.  
Mainly, Enterprises’ economic models are still based on the industrial way of thinking, 
no matter their activities. We have to introduce a difference between tertiarization and 
servicialization following François Hubault (2013). Tertiarization refers to the way activities 
are listed in traditional activities’ classification – agriculture and extraction; manufacturing; 
and services). Servicialization deal with the specific changes in value creation process 
induced by the development of relational and immaterial aspects into activities. So, there 
are some enterprises from the manufacturing sector in which we do observe a servicial logic 
in action. On the other hand, there are enterprises from the tertiary sector in which the 
industrial logic is the main reference. We will present some cases showing that remarkably 
in this article. According to the logic inspiring the enterprises’ manager, the economic 
performance conception changes as well.  
Classically, the industrial way of thinking considers performance as a sequence made of 
quality, productivity, and profitability. Quality is though as a stable dimension. It 
corresponds to measurable and countable dimensions of the production, even if the 
production does not result in a good but in a service. In that case, the quality takes the form 
of the material support of service or measurable aspect of the service done – time spend, 
amount of contacts, amount of operations done… This focus on countable aspects of the 
production meet the idea of matching rules between human workforce and the machines. 
So, with a standard quality, any enterprise director should be able to find tasks that might be 
automatized and clearly evaluate the value creation process efficiency. The quality supposed 
stability makes the work division by task possible. The clear identification of the result allows 
directors to think of productivity relying on three king of lever: scales economies, labour 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
237 
intensification and technical improvements. If a productive unit’s director is good enough in 
the quest for productivity, then profitability should develop.  
This economic model has shown its efficiency for the years following World War II in 
France. But in the late 1960’s it started to lost some of its relevance. In 1970’s it reaches its 
limits because of market saturation for amenities such as cars or domestic electricals. 
Consequentially, the sequence quality, productivity and profitability have been turned 
upside down by the financialization phenomena. This phenomena refers to a process linking 
two dimensions: first the increasing of the non-banking financing in the economy; second, 
the subsequent leadership taken by financial motives in companies’ strategy (Bourguinat 
2006; du Tertre 2005 & 2009). It means that profitability rate is now the first reference for 
the production planners. Investors determine the expected profitability rate. To reach that 
amount of profitability, production units’ directors have to find ways to increase 
productivity. Then, quality is seen as a residue. In a saturated market, low quality means the 
capacity to assume low prices, allowing the market growth for a moment. But quickly it leads 
to an over competitive situation, in which prices are the main weapon. This has led a lot of 
enterprises in a pathway leading to a dead end. In that situation, sustainability is radically 
against the enterprise trajectory. 
For the developing immaterial and relational activities, the tension is even higher 
because of the activities’ nature itself. In these activities, beneficiaries enter production 
processes, bringing in non-manageable sources of dictate. They also bring their subjectivity 
in, making each service singular. The relational aspect of these activities also results in 
involving the workers’ subjectivity. All this make the value creation process more complex 
and less predictable. The subjective commitment rises and the temporal aspects of labour 
change toward something harder to count, indeed uncountable (Dejours 2015).  
The traditional approach considering a homogenous, divisible, and objectively 
measurable worktime is not relevant for such activities. The worktime cannot be the 
reference for value creation measure anymore. Multiple effects of this lack of relevance 
from the industrial conceptual framework and its practical translations can be identified 
today. Economically speaking, it leads to dysfunctions, low quality, value destruction, and an 
incapacity to summerize the value created. In social and health terms, it causes new labour 
pathologies as musculoskeletal problems and psychosocial troubles as burn out. Induced 
sides effects, known as externalities are not considered in the industrial model (du Tertre 
2005; 2006; 2009). Those externalities can’t last any longer, regarding to nowadays 
knowledge about global warming and other environmental issues. All this make the authors 
getting to the conclusion that the industrial model is in a dead end (du Tertre 2013; Benqué, 
Vuidel & du Tertre 2014; Dejours 2015; Demissy & Kniaz 2016; Vuidel 2016). 

 
NBM@Graz2017

From this assessment, new economic models inspired by a more servicial way of 
thinking emerge. These new economic models, such as Functional and Cooperative Economy 
(FCE) seems to be more relevant regarding sustainable development (Benqué, du Tertre and 
Vuidel 2014). When an enterprise engages itself toward a service-based economic model, it 
means several changes in the way the enterprise is organised, in the way value is created 
and the way the value produced is then transformed into monetary flux. First the quality 
cannot be considered as stable and foreseen dimension anymore. In servicial activities, the 
quality does not lie in the result of the service, but also in the production process. In 
addition, quality in co-created with the beneficiary. This means that the quality depends on 
his commitment in the process. So, the resources mobilized in the production includes the 
beneficiary ones. In such activities, productivity is not a matter of scale anymore, nor a 
matter of labor intensification or a question of technical innovation. Trust helps getting 
more productive, as the capacity to adapt to the beneficiary or the capacity to find 
complementary skills according to the situation. As a result, productivity is based on 
responsiveness 
and 
flexibility; 
relevant 
goods 
and 
services 
association; 
skills 
complementation; and adoption economies resulting from the “stability if the links with the 
beneficiary” (Benké, Vuidel and du Tertre 2014).  
Those changes take the form of new kind of relationship between producers and clients 
whose are closely cooperating. This means new kind of contracts and new invoicing 
practices. It also means new displays to evaluate the relation’s production. The evaluation 
should not only take account of the result, but also of the effects generated along the whole 
production process. This evaluation should consider the externalities, and the effects on the 
people involved as a part of the overall performance. With these evaluation changes, the 
units chosen to summarize the company offers must change as well. Contractual issues and 
invoicing practices are two important dimension in companies’ business models. We make a 
distinction in this paper between economic model – dealing with the way value is created – 
and business model – the way value is changed into monetary flux (Gaglio, Lauriol and du 
Tertre 2011). An enterprise engaged in a path toward new economic model should face 
tension about its business model as well.  
To investigate these questions, we will expose enterprises experimenting an economic 
model shift. These enterprises have been accompanied by ATEMIS and more specifically by 
both the authors on their pathway toward a new economic model. For each case, we will 
expose the kind of change in which these enterprises are engaged, and the difficulties they 
are facing in terms of new business model building. We will develop two business cases 
here. The first one is cleanliness French enterprises. This sector has developed a deeply 
industrial conception of its activities which appears in these enterprises organization, 
evaluation process and business model. In practice, these activities are getting more 
servicial, and rely on a real-time cooperation between producers and beneficiaries. The 
second business case refers to an enterprise from the French Hauts-de-France region. This 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
239 
enterprise first was a medical call center. It progressively changes its relations with general 
practitioners toward a health prevention service. The pathway toward a new economic 
model continues toward a local medical desertification prevention service. Those changes 
are questioning this company, especially about the kind of contract it can propose and the 
business model it could refer to.  
From the industrial model to the servicial model: what new business 
model for cleanliness enterprises ?  
In France, the cleaning industry first enterprises were founded in the 19th century. They were 
developed to support industrial activities as production plants, upkeep activities or harbour 
activities. This emerging sector has grown fast from the 1970’s and the externalization 
phenomena affecting industrial activities in that period. Since then, the sector was 
developing continuously. Nonetheless, in the last twenty years, the sector is facing economic 
and social issues. The cleanliness activities suffer from a negative representation (Hughes 
1996), and endure difficulties to enhance the value of their production. The customers are 
constantly pressuring to get prices as low as possible. Margins get lower and lower 
consequently since 2007 (4.2% in 2007, 2.6% in 20121). Prices tend to be the main purpose 
in the competition on cleanliness market. At the same time, the work organisation and the 
underlying economic stakes are producing several social unwanted effects – part time jobs, 
out of sync worktime, tiresome labour, lack of acknowledgement, lack of social 
enhancement… In addition, the service is not fully satisfying the customers.  
Facing these difficulties, some enterprises in this sector have started to change the way 
they organize their service and workforce. This change opens new economic possibilities 
calling for new kind of contract, of invoicing and evaluation practices.  
Cleaning; a service thought in an industrial way. 
Even if in France Cleaning is classified as a service, it is mainly thought and organized as an 
industry activity. The activity’s result is thought as the absence of dust or some material 
removal. Secondly, the technical aspects of the service are the only aspects considered. The 
service is defined as an amount of square meters to clean, a frequency of cleaning and a 
price by hour. In this sector, performance is thought as in the classical industrial way, by a 
sequence of quality – productivity – profitability. The quality is considered as something 
objective and reproducible from a client to another. This means that the offer may always fit 
into the same specifications bill, no matter the client. Productivity mainly relies on labour 
intensification. A certain rate of square meters cleaned by hour must be reached to get 
some profitability. Increasing the amount of square meters cleaned per unit of time is seen 
as a sign of performance. Time is the central reference in the performance approach (Le 
Dilosquer & De Gasparo 2017). This is a striking dimension form the industrial model greatly 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
240 
influencing the way contracts are built. Effectively, in that sector, enterprises transform 
value into money by selling, not an amount of goods, but of cleaning time understood quite 
as a good.  
In addition, since the externalization phenomena in the 1980’s, the cleaning services 
took place in displaced times from the customers’ activity. The cleaning work is done very 
early in the morning or very late in the evening. This contribute to build a separation 
between production time and consumption time as it is in the industrial activities. It also 
creates social externalities for the workers – family time or health issues for example. 
When cleaning in co-activity brings some changes. 
For ten years now, some enterprises from cleanliness sector have adopted a new temporal 
organization to avoid some of the negative consequences exposed here. They first tried to 
develop cleaning intervention in daytime, to reduce the amount of part time jobs. This 
change appears to be more than a working time change. Cleaning in daytime means that the 
beneficiary is here, opening the possibility for a relational service. The nature of the service 
itself changes because of the subjective commitment, the cooperation with the customer’s 
worker and the arbitration needed between every kind of prescription resulting of the co-
presence. From all this, the point is not to intervene in an inert environment to clean 
furniture and floor areas anymore, but to intervene into singular and unpredictable 
situations.  
The traditional economic concepts are unsettled by this activity based on relation. 
Productivity cannot be reduced to the optimization of a relation between time and surface. 
In co-activity, the cleanliness agent must deal with the workers’ different uses of the place. 
The agent should consider the customer’s workers’ habits. Knowing these habits allows 
him/her to adapt his intervention to get more efficient and more relevant. Adoption 
economies supplant scales economies. Time/space ratio is not relevant anymore.  
Though this example of cleanliness sector, we see how the activity changes. We do 
understand the emerging difference in the way value is created into the co-activity situation. 
But if the activity business model is still strongly inspired by industrial logic then, those 
changes are not acknowledged which may cause externalities and may lead to more 
difficulty for workers.  
 Toward a new business model 
In French cleaning industry, displays are getting set to accompany the enterprises evolution 
toward a more servicial activity. The dynamics meet difficulties about contract conception 
and invoicing. The point is to find an alternative to contracts based on selling an amount of 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
241 
technical work expressed in hours. The aim is to find a way to allow agreement between 
stakeholders about the value effectively created. Some of the enterprises we have 
accompanied have experienced new practices with their clients. The first thing they have 
done was to plan time with their customer to build a specification bill as close as possible to 
the building users’ expectations. The result of this is an agreement on what is cleanliness 
adapted to a specific workplace and the specific uses of this workplace. To do so, the joint 
contractors build up a hierarchization of the actions to be taken rather than a list of tasks. It 
results in a new specification bill defining the performance to reach, adapted to the 
workplace uses and not in an amount of hours calculated from standardized criteria.  
Labour evaluation displays are also questioned in those experiments. In the industrial 
model, labour evaluation is based on compliance controls. In these controls, the point is to 
measure the gap between the obtained result and the forecast result. In case of a gap, the 
contract plans financial sanctions. In the experiment, evaluation have two main objectives: 
professionalization and innovation. The performance agreement forecasts the overtaking of 
prescription. Therefore, the point is not to check the compliance anymore, but to check the 
relevance of the intervention. This relevance cannot be totally forecasted. This means that 
evaluation times are occasions to improve the arbitrations done by the cleanliness agent to 
answer a specific situation. Doing so helps the agent in their capacity to act in cooperation 
with the beneficiaries in situation. In other words, the evaluation time improve the agent’s 
proficiency. In the same time, the evaluation process reveal some of the customer’s 
expectation which were unthought in the performance agreement. These lacks may be 
corrected and then reintroduced in the cleanliness companies’ offer. 
From the industrial call center to an ecosystem struggling against local 
medical desertification 
In France, general practitioners often work alone in their own office. They were used to deal 
with their agenda management by themselves or by employing a medical secretary. Like the 
cleanliness sector, the medical secretary work has been externalised in the past 20 years. 
Digital technologies have allowed new actors to deal with incoming calls from the patients 
and organizing the doctors’ agenda. In that quite new activity, an industrial logic quickly 
dominates. The doctors seemed not willing to pay much attention to the quality of the 
service as long as their agenda got full enough. On the offer side, the pioneers on this 
market search to offer the lowest price by call and build a strategy based on a volume 
growth. Years later, the race toward the lowest cost have led those enterprises abroad. 
Patient started to complain about the quality of the answers they have got to their phone 
calls. They mainly complain to the doctors about the fact that the persons answering seems 
to not be able to deal with anything else than giving a rendezvous, when they are expecting 
medical advices or just somebody that listen to them. On the general practitioners’ side, 
health issues started to mount seriously. These issues were the result of the growing lack of

doctors in some places, because of their rarity, or the growing need in the most populated 
areas.  
In that context, a company from the French Hauts-de-France region was seeking for an 
alternative to the industrial model. The owner did not resign himself to leave France to find 
workforce at a lower price. He decided to search for a solution based on a new relationship 
with the practitioners. In 2012, after an accompaniment in his pathway toward functional 
and cooperative economy (FCE), he started to build up a new offer. Building this offer had 
two main consequences: First he had to imagine a new way to make his invoices; second, his 
service attracts local governments improving the purpose of the solution.  
From selling an amount of calls toward health prevention and qualitative 
answers.  
In the industrial perspective, this enterprise was selling an amount of calls dealt with. 
Basically, when a patient wanted to get a rendezvous, he/she calls the company which check 
the doctor’s agenda and fills it with the requested rendezvous. The more the company filled 
the doctor’s agenda, the more it earns money. From time to time, the company’s workers 
noticed that some doctors do not fulfil their rendezvous. Other were said to be unpleasant 
with their patient. All complains were getting to the company who has no way to deal with 
it.  
Facing this, the company owner decided to experiment a new value offer toward some 
practitioners. He asked them about their main problem and expectations. Most of them 
worried about the lack of time to rest. The company soon proposed a solution to reduce 
practitioners’ activity when some signs of overwork are detected. To do so, the company 
have to deal with some of the patients’ questions. The enterprise should also propose to the 
patient to meet another practitioner less occupied in the same area. By this solution, the 
company succeed in selling something else than an amount of calls dealt with. The problem 
is that something appears to be more complex to identify and understand.  
A part of it was health issues prevention for the practitioners. As this effect could be 
obtained by limiting the amount of rendezvous taken, it cannot be paid on the same basis as 
before. Moreover, a part of the solution is to make some of the rendezvous shift to another 
doctor. Invoicing the rendezvous effectively taken would have meant reducing the cost to 
the one benefiting of the solution and rising it for the one who is helping! Another part of 
the solution is to deal directly with some of the patients calls, which means reducing the 
amount of rendezvous. At last, to get the performance, the company’s worker must spend 
more time on the phone to decide if they can deal with the demand or if it could be taken by 
any doctor, or if the patient must have a rendezvous with his/her doctor.  

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
243 
In the former service, invoicing was quite easy. The company just have to count the 
amount of rendezvous taken. Nowadays, the company have to evaluate the quality of the 
service to determine how worth it is for each practitioner. As a result, two directions have 
been taken to invoice this service. The first one is to continue to count the amount of 
rendezvous with a higher price per unit because the doctors acknowledge the value of the 
service even if they can’t give it a price. The other solution is to create a fix monthly payment 
satisfying the company and the doctor and allowing the company to continue its efforts to 
prevent doctors overwork situations.  
From an individual solution to a territorial policy to struggle against 
medical desertification.  
The company’s capacity to take care of the doctors’ overwork issues, quickly had a positive 
side effect: some retiring doctors advises the new comer replacing them to use the service. 
This positive sign paired up with a change in general practitioners’ general expectation. The 
retiring doctors gave a big part of their personal time for their professional activity. The new 
generation of general practitioner seem to pay more attention at the balance between their 
professional and their personal life. The company started to imagine solutions to help new 
doctor’ installation, by helping them getting patients from overworked doctors, and keeping 
the precious balance between professional and personal times. This solution soon attracts 
the local governments’ attention. Indeed, the French Hauts-de-France region, as other 
region in France, suffers from medical desertification in several areas. Some of the local 
government started to call the company to get some help to attract doctors.  
To do so, the company had to rely on its good relationship with the doctors’ 
professional organization (French medical association) within the region. The company was 
already working with some replacement doctors. An agreement was found to help those 
replacement doctors to locate in places where medical presence is needed. The result is the 
possibility to get replacement doctors in an area to prevent a local doctor’s overwork 
situation. Doing so, it also brings new access to medical services to inhabitants. At last, it 
gives to replacement doctors an occasion to test locations in areas needing them, right now 
or a bit later. The result is that some of these doctors effectively decided to locate in the 
places where they had the occasion to work in.  
The uprising question interesting us here is: who should pay for this solution? The fact 
is, several actors do benefit of the solution. How the company should conceive its new 
business model for this solution? Is it still a matter of business ?  
 
 

 
NBM@Graz2017

From a business model to an ecosystem financing. 
When this medical call centre changes to a solution carrier for practitioner and local 
governments, the actors’ system got more complex too. Meanwhile, the economic model 
gets more complex too. The industrial way seems particularly irrelevant for the new solution 
as the main effect result in avoiding health issues and creating attractiveness for territory by 
reducing the amount of rendezvous taken by doctors. Those two main effects are 
particularly difficult to forecast and uncountable. Creating a new convention about how a 
monetary retribution should be addressed to the solution carrier do not seem to be a 
business model question anymore. It rather seems to be a question of financing a territorial 
solution, a territorial ecosystem.  
In terms of contract, this solution calls for a multilateral contract including at least the 
local government, the doctors and the solution carrier. As a health prevention service, the 
solution might also interest the French Social Security System. The problem that emerges 
from now is that each actor has their own logic and their own temporality. This solution 
would need time to get built. The company is now working to get all the ecosystem together 
which means spending a lot of time explaining how the solution works and revealing the 
potential value it could bring to the local population. Out of the solution conception issues, 
there is another task particularly complex to deal with for the company owner: this 
enterprise is creating a new profession, radically different from the call centre one. 
Developing the new solution would mean getting the whole team ready.  
Conclusion  
In both situations, we have seen how getting into a more servicial economic model leads 
to important changes in the business model. We also notice that putting some distance with 
the industrial references do not solve the question. In fact, it just open wide the question of 
new invoicing and contracting practices. In both cases, the instruction of the new business 
model goes through a deeper cooperation with the former customer and partner about the 
service conception and its evaluation. The conception and evaluation processes themselves 
are supposed to changes deeply. Evaluation is not meant to stand a compliance test as 
conception is not finishing when the service started. Evaluation appears as a key point of the 
new model conception. Therefore, the new services must integrate evaluation displays 
allowing the stakeholders to contribute to the solution performance in a quite long period. 
Such relationships mean to take some distance with the market conception of the 
exchanges, as it means the broadcasting of a servicial conceptual framework.

Introduction and Theoretical Background 
Research and practice on business sustainability is mainly framed using an instrumental logic 
that asks how can businesses benefit from incorporating sustainability issues into their 
activities rather than how can businesses significantly contribute to sustainable 
development. In contrast to the increasing emphasis on an integrated and balanced 
approach, the number of studies on the relationship between financial profitability and 
sustainability prove the scientific and practical dominance of the economic domain 
(Montabon et al. 2016; Eccles et al. 2014; Bonini & Görner 2011; Orlitzky et al. 2003). Yet, 
many concepts already exist which describe how companies can create value for the 
common good, apart from maximizing financial profits. Amongst those approaches are 
discussions on an ethical level like conscious capitalism, theories on the purpose of business 
like shared value (Porter & Kramer 2011), or practical suggestions by NGOs or consultancies. 
But nevertheless, researchers conclude that academics and practitioners still predominantly 
focus on the financial outcomes of sustainability activities rather than on the impacts on 
society and a broader understanding of value creation (Crane et al. 2014; Banerjee 2011; 
Hahn et al. 2010; Margolis & Walsh 2003). Thus, current sustainability management 
approaches fail to support businesses “in identifying and attaining goals that contribute 
significantly to sustainable development” (Baumgartner & Rauter 2017). This predominant 
inside-out perspective leads to an overemphasis on the business and the economic domain 
and results in an asymmetric value creation in which the needs of the wider society and the 
planet are neglected. Hence, there is a discrepancy between microeconomic-level 
improvements and macroeconomic-level deterioration which is described as a big 
disconnect between business activities and the overall state of the planet (Dyllick & Muff 
2016; Whiteman et al. 2013). Besides, researchers in the field of strategic sustainability 
management argue that the reason for the limited impact and effectiveness of sustainability 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
248 
management approaches is the lack of strategic orientation of sustainability practices and 
the incompatibility between strategy content and societal needs (Baumgartner & Rauter 
2017; Baumgartner & Korhonen 2010). They call for an improvement of the strategic 
relevance and integration of sustainability management in the sense that both businesses 
and sustainable development benefit. Besides this tension between business and society, 
companies are confronted with intertemporal tensions between short term and long term. 
Slawinski and Bansal (2015) conclude that the reason for the misalignment between 
business and society is the separation between short-term business goals and long-term 
societal goals. In reality, these two levels are interrelated and businesses need to juxtapose 
the intertemporal tensions and treat them as a paradox in order to align business goals and 
societal needs in the long run. Consequently, in order to ensure that sustainability efforts on 
the business level effectively contribute to the goals of sustainable development, business 
activities need to be directly linked to global sustainability challenges and integrated into a 
firm’s core business. 
The importance of the private sector to successfully tackle sustainability challenges have 
become integrated into a joint global consensus around the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) (United Nations 2015). Those goals are replacing the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs) and shape the agenda for sustainable development until 2030. Unlike the MDGs, the 
SDGs explicitly address the responsibility of businesses in sustainable development, and - for 
the first time ever - point to their important role for a success (von Angerer et al. 2016). 
Although the MDGs were never really addressed by businesses, the private sector largely 
contributed to their success, mainly indirectly through the creation of jobs (Stuart et al. 
2016). Since the adoption of the SDGs, governmental institutions, NGOs and different actors 
in the private sector developed several guidelines and tools to support businesses in fulfilling 
their responsibility (e.g. Corporate Citizenship 2015; GRI, UN Global Compact & WBCSD 
2015; UN Global Compact, KPMG 2015). Besides, there are studies showing the different 
relevance of global sustainability challenges and assessing the attainment of the SDGs on a 
national level (Muff, Kapalka, Dyllick 2017; Globescan & SustainAbility 2017). The Gap Frame 
by Muff et al. (2017) translates the global SDGs into relevant actions on national level and 
provides a business tool to address them strategically. Recent studies show, that less than 
one in ten businesses do not intend to consider the SDGs for goal setting and general 
sustainability management (Globescan & SustainAbility 2017; BSR & GlobeScan 2016). Quite 
contrarily the same study reports that businesses see the SDGs as a chance to align their 
core activities as well as innovation efforts with societal needs. Climate action was identified 
as receiving the most attention within corporations. Another study shows that 92% of 
businesses are aware of the SDGs but only 13% identified the appropriate tools they need to 
take action (PwC 2015). Hence, consistent approaches and clear instructions or tools how 
the complex SDGs can be addressed by the private sector are still missing (Corporate 
Citizenship 2015).  

 
NBM@Graz2017

Agarwal et al. (2017) criticize current forms of engagement which are often based on a 
limited business case thinking and a focus on win-win situations which lead to self-serving 
sustainability activities. Accordingly, companies fail to meaningfully contribute to some of 
society’s most pressing sustainability challenges. The pressure on the private sector to 
effectively support sustainable development not only comes from international institutions 
or NGOs but also from customers. More and more people value sustainable products or 
services and expect businesses to act in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. 
A study shows that 90% of citizens believe the private sector is important to reach the SDGs 
and 78% prefer goods and services of companies that had signed up to the SDGs (PwC 2015). 
But solely reacting to customer’s wishes is again another form of taking advantage of a win-
win situation. What we need is a robust framework that helps to guide businesses towards 
addressing the SDGs. 
Research Questions and Objectives 
Against this background, the overarching research leading question for this working paper 
and bigger research project is “How can companies effectively contribute to sustainable 
development?”. 
In order to answer this question, three sub-questions will be addressed and working-
packages will be defined to answer these questions respectively. At this early research stage, 
the working paper addresses mainly the first research question. The second and third 
questions have to be left to future research objectives. The following explanations describe 
the questions in more detail and illustrate how they are embedded in a broader context. 
RQ1: What are the societal value contributions a company should aim at in order to 
contribute effectively to sustainable development? 
RQ2: How can these societal value contributions be translated into strategic goals? 
RQ3: What does a business model look like that effectively guides companies in 
putting their strategies into action? 
When analyzing the SDGs it becomes apparent that the goals are interconnected and 
interdependent (Nilsson et al. 2016). Due to this complexity it is difficult for companies to 
find appropriate goals which fit their competencies and at the same time effectively address 
a specific sustainability challenge. Therefore, the need to clarify what sustainable 
development means for businesses emerges. In order to enable business to contribute to 
sustainable development and to improve the strategic relevance of SDGs, they have to be 
more specific and focus on company level. To do so, it is necessary to find a mechanism 
which translates the SDGs on a global level into concrete sustainability topics on business 
level, which can be addressed strategically and integrated into corporate strategy. We call

this transmission societal value contributions (SVCs). The SVC concept should serve as a 
translator for companies to translate the global SDGs and to formulate sustainability topics 
which can be addressed effectively. This means to focus on issues and themes which can 
explicitly be addressed by companies. Strategically addressing the SVCs and their deducted 
themes can help to overcome the missing effectiveness and prevalent reductionism 
identified by Baumgartner & Korhonen (2010). This is a first step to operationalize an 
outside-in perspective developed by Dyllick and Muff (2016), which allows for effective 
contributions to sustainable development and represents what they call true business 
sustainability. By defining relevant sustainability challenges and taking them as a starting 
point for strategy and business model development, companies are enabled to make 
significant contributions towards sustainable development (RQ1). 
On a next level, the SVCs build the starting point (i.e. the purpose) for the business 
strategy and define a vision of success. To develop strategies for business, they need to be 
based on its core competencies in order to be efficient.  Several studies show that the SDGs 
receive different attention and relevance within organizations (Globescan & SustainAbility 
2017; Corporate Citizenship 2015). Agarwal et al. (2017) conclude that businesses should not 
aim to address all SDGs but prioritize goals and focus on those areas where the greatest 
impact is possible.  At the time they need to take their resources and capabilities, 
respectively its core competencies, as well as the country and sector the business is 
operating in into account. This should not be confused with ‘cherry-picking’ those goals that 
are most comfortable for the company to address. Prioritizing makes sense as companies 
have limited resources, different abilities and relative advantages or disadvantages for 
problem solving so that it becomes necessary in order to address global sustainability 
challenges most efficiently. 
Additionally, the SVCs provide not only orientation but also purpose for the business. 
Purpose is defined “as a concrete goal or objective for the firm that reaches beyond profit 
maximization” (Henderson & Van den Steen 2015). In research and practice, purpose-driven 
businesses are an increasing phenomenon with promising impacts regarding value creation 
for both business and society (Henderson & Van den Steen 2015; Zendlmayer 2015). By 
aligning the core competencies towards relevant SVC, business strategies that effectively 
address global sustainability challenges can be developed. Taking SVCs as a starting point for 
iterative strategy development and incorporating them into strategy content, supports both 
the operationalization of an outside-in approach as well as enables a strategic integration of 
sustainability management. This process and the concrete business themes help companies 
to set appropriate goals that align their strategic orientation and strategy content with 
societal needs. Following figure illustrates the conceptual basis and shows the duality of 
purpose and core competencies. (RQ 2) 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
251 
 
Figure 1: SVCs and strategy - Duality of core competences and 
purpose (own illustration) 
Finally, the specific topics and strategies need to be integrated into an effective business 
model that guides companies in putting their strategies into action. In the literature there is 
still no satisfactory distinction or relation of the two concepts. For the sake of this paper, we 
will consider them as interdependent, closely related but distinct aspects of a company. It 
can be argued that the decision for a certain business model is a strategic one, on the other 
hand this decision also influences the course of strategy a company pursues. Strategic 
decisions are often based on the core competencies of a firm, yet some of the building 
blocks of a business model, e.g. the key resources, or even the business model as a whole 
can be considered as such a strategic advantage. Although this very rough description serves 
the purpose of this working paper, this complex relationship needs to be further analyzed 
and defined in order to answer the second and third research question. Yet it already 
illustrates the complexity and ambiguity when working with those definitions. Foremost, in 
this paper the concept of corporate strategy and business model will be used to break the 
global SDGs down to company level and to operationalize business contributions to SDGs. 
(RQ 3) 
The following figure illustrates the transmission paths and the relationships between the 
different levels.

Figure 2: Connecting SDGs to the business level (own illustration) 
By answering the research questions, the research project aims at connecting the global, 
societal level (i.e. the state of the planet) and the business level, manifesting in the firm's 
strategy and business model. The introduction of business themes and SVCs shall serve as a 
transmission mechanism to bridge the gap between the societal- and business-level and aim 
at an inclusive and symmetric value creation as well as at a strategic integration of 
sustainability management. By translating SDGs into concrete sustainability topics for 
business action, the SDGs can be addressed more effectively by companies and integrated 
into strategic management in a language business understands rather than abstract, global 
goals. Furthermore, this research also aims at contributing towards the theoretical 
foundation of a new way of doing business, connecting concepts like the resource-based 
view of a firm, its strategy, business model and sustainable development. 
Methodology 
In search for the values business should aim at in order to effectively address sustainable 
development and to contribute towards a more just and sustainable planet, existing 
concepts related to businesses and sustainable development respectively SDGs need to be 
analyzed carefully for recurring communalities. This qualitative meta- or conceptual-analysis 
of existing concepts aims at systematizing and restructuring the value discussion in order to 
identify important elements and similarities. It does not aim at establishing a universal truth 
and general approach towards sustainable development for businesses because the 
challenges and actions to address these challenges highly depend on the industry and 
context of the company. Instead, it has the goal to support companies in their efforts to 
contribute towards generating societal value in a very specific, case dependent manner for a 
single firm or an industry at most.

Initially following publications were analyzed: SDG Compass (GRI, UN Global Compact, 
WBCSD 2015), Valuing the SDGs prize (AlphaBeta 2017) and SDGs mean business (Ugarte et 
al. 2017). These three contributions were selected based on their high relevance for the 
research question. In a first step their suggestions for business actions to address the SDGs 
on a company level were identified. In a next step those suggestions were aggregated and 
clustered into topics on a generic level. Through logical deduction and in various feedback 
rounds the authors identified overarching patterns in value creation, which were defined as 
SVCs. The program atlas.ti was used for documentation and structuring of the analysis (see 
figure 5 in the appendix).  
In order to refine the results, the idea and principles of the Framework for Strategic 
Sustainable Development (FSSD) by Broman and Robèrt (2015) were used and combined 
with the previously conducted analysis of societal value creation. “It is difficult to know 
whether any given scenario is a truly sustainable or not if it is not framed by and assessed 
against a principled definition of sustainability” (Broman & Robèrt 2015). Consequently, 
these principles were applied to enhance the analysis. 
 
Figure 3: Method and research process (own illustration) 
Early Findings and Preliminary Results  
Whereas in the past business contributions to sustainable development were rather a 
byproduct of economic development (e.g. increased wealth through the creation of jobs and 
industrialization), a prospering future demands a strategic and coordinated approach for 
actions in this area. The interconnectedness and interaction of the SDGs reveal and highlight 
the necessity of SVCs. 
* The FSSD Principles were 
translated into positive statements/ 
contributions and related to resp. 
combined with the identified 
categories of SVCs (see table 3 in 
the appendix) 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
254 
Our initial research identified 11 distinct SVCs, ranging from topics like transparency 
to biodiversity, environmental protection and animal welfare (see Table 1), covering the 
dimensions of environment, society, economy and governance. 
Table 1: Societal Value Contributions across four dimensions 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Each of the 11 SVCs covers several themes, from which in turn the topics for businesses 
can be deducted. For example the environmental SVC “Efficiency” comprises topics such as 
resource and energy efficiency and concepts like the circular economy, optimized packaging 
and modular design, across products and services, as well as processes. “Reliable and 
affordable (basic) services” specifies the provision of services for a range of areas, including 
healthcare, food and water, electricity and energy, sanitation, resources, infrastructure, 
housing, financial services, mobility and education. For each of those SVCs concrete business 
actions shall be defined in the next step of the research process. This means after 
aggregating several concepts in order to define the SVCs, the next step is to combine the 
strengths of each concept and build a comprehensive list of topics for businesses to 
effectively address sustainability challenges.  “Reliable and affordable (basic) services” (see 
Table 2) shall serve as an illustration of this step of the research process.

From these topics, concrete actions can be deducted. Those actions symbolize a 
concrete way to achieve the ideal state, namely the SVCs. Those actions are highly 
dependent on the specific industry and context. In the context of the provision of food and 
water, a company like Nestlé might include measures such as the reduction of unhealthy 
ingredients (saturated fat, sugar, conservatives) or the promotion of healthy living into their 
business. The reduction of pesticides and efficient use of fertilizer within their supply chain is 
another example and suitable for grocery retailers like Aldi Süd, who banned the use of 
certain pesticides for their fruit and vegetable suppliers in 2016 (Neue Zürcher Zeitung 
2016). 
Although the research is in a very early stage it already shows some interesting 
preliminary results. Besides the SVCs and business topics, further interesting observations 
regarding the contribution of businesses towards sustainable development can be made. 
Based on the analysis, a distinction between direct and indirect influence can be identified. 
This means for instance that “Non-discrimination, equal opportunities and inclusion” can be 
created by either implementing measures within the organization, which address the goals 
directly, like equal pay for men and women. Or it can be addressed indirectly by supporting 
access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services and providing information for both 
men and women in the local community. The distinction between direct and indirect 
influence is highly important as it reveals a set of different business topics and actions within 
the SVCs. Furthermore, it illustrates the complexity and interdependency of the topic as a 
whole. 
Besides the direct and indirect influence on different SVCs, several so called 
‘transmission paths’ (or modes of implementation) were identified throughout the analysis. 
In addition to the concrete SVCs and topics businesses can aim at, the ways to implement 
appropriate measures form an important building-block in the discussion about how 
businesses can contribute to sustainable development. Besides ‘indirect or direct’, the two 
identified dimension are ‘alone or together’ and ‘organizational or institutional level’. The 
first distinction refers to the degree of cooperation whereas the latter points to the scope of 
action (organizational aspects or a change the rules of the game on a broader level). In these 
three dimensions, six transmission paths for SVCs were identified, which show possibilities 
for companies how to address the SVCs effectively. These transmission paths can support 
the definition of a robust framework for business contributions and reveal options for 
strategy or business model development.  
1) Investment and innovation (including technological, environmental investments and 
investment in infrastructure and R&D) 
2) Awareness and education (e.g. customer education, awareness rising) 
3) Industry standards (require and support business partners to do the same)

4) Collaboration and partnerships with other stakeholders throughout the value chain, 
academics, governments, civil society and international organizations or NGOs 
5) Knowledge sharing and technology transfer (open innovation, open source 
knowledge platforms), capacity building 
6) Establishing long-term business relationships 
Conclusion, Implication and Outlook 
The list of SVCs build a solid basis for further specification and deduction of concrete 
business topics and actions. The extensiveness of this list of SVCs does not mean that one 
company should address all of them, on the contrary. Comparable to the SDGs, companies 
should focus on the areas with the highest possible impact and prioritize SVCs based on their 
capabilities, resources and market position. Additionally, state governments and other 
private or public institutions have a shared responsibility to provide the 11 SVCs. Although 
the role and power of businesses should not be underestimated, it needs to be specified 
which SVCs businesses are able to directly contribute to, which one the government or other 
institutions need to provide and which ones can be achieved through joint efforts or by 
business alone. 
In order to explore more angles on possible societal value contributions of businesses, 
further publications and studies will be analyzed to enhance and refine the list of business 
topics and actions. Those results will undergo several feedback rounds with experts. In a 
next step those generic findings can be adjusted and broken down to fit the needs of a more 
concrete industry contexts and to define strategic business goals as well as building blocks of 
business models for sustainable development. This can happen through workshops with 
industry experts, at the same time testing for the applicability and usefulness of the whole 
concept.  
The developed list of SVCs can serve as a starting point for strategy formulation 
(strategic content) and business model development. The identified transmission paths can 
supplement the framework for business contributions to sustainable development and, 
especially in a specific industry context, facilitate effective contributions towards sustainable 
development from businesses. Yet, some critical points need to be taken into account. First 
of all this area of research is fairly new and unexplored, which limits the theoretical 
foundation it can build on. Additionally, the scientific method is based on qualitative and 
conceptual work as well as it is a qualitative method by itself. This could lead to weaknesses 
regarding robustness and validity, and especially replicability of results. Nevertheless, this 
approach shall serve as a solid basis for further investigations about the role of businesses in 
addressing sustainability challenges and most importantly the identification of effective 
business actions to contribute towards the generation of positive societal value.

Abstract 
Increasingly, the topic of business model innovation (BMI) is getting attention from 
management scholars. Defined as the practices to develop new ways of creating, delivering, 
and capturing value, BMI occurs by either designing and implementing a radically new 
business model (BM) or by improving the current BM. Resting on the notion that a new, 
more effective BM has greater value than a novel product or technology per se, numerous 
studies have been carried out to broaden its theoretical horizons. The success of BMI 
implementation is one of the emerging research areas, addressing the circumstances under 
which the implementation of a new BM enhances firms’ performance. In this sense, we 
propose the inclusion of factors affecting the success of BMI as one of the future research 
directions in BMI literature. This study thereby intends to identify the most critical factors 
influencing the performance effect of BMI. To achieve this, we conduct a literature review to 
build up a conceptual model consisting of four propositions regarding three antecedent roles 
of knowledge management capability (the ability to create, retain, and transfer new 
knowledge), organisational agility (the capability to rapidly detect environmental changes 
and adapt in response to them), and BM ambidexterity (the ability to manage two different 
BMs concurrently), as well as the moderating influence of environmental dynamism (the 
extent to which the business environment is changing and volatile). This study contributes to 
the growing BMI literature by taking the dynamic capabilities perspective and developing a 
conceptual model that further explains which variables affect the success of BMI.

Introduction 
Since the explosion of the World Wide Web and the “dotcom” boom of the mid-1990s, 
attention is being paid to the topic of business model (BM) and especially recently to 
business model innovation (BMI). The term BM has been defined as a conceptual schema 
that explains the logic of doing business and the way a firm creates, proposes, delivers, and 
captures value (Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010; Zott et al., 2011). Extending the BM concept 
into the realm of incremental innovation, a body of scholars acknowledge BMI as the 
practices to innovate the firm’s BM, in a way that one or multiple elements of the BM 
change to improve the performance (Frankenberger et al., 2013).  
BMI, relative to the other types of innovation, potentially influences firm performance 
(Kim and Min, 2015). That is, a number of scholars have recently begun to enrich the BMI 
literature, probing into the ways it drives the odds of business performance. In this sense, 
the success of BMI seems to be studied without going deeply into the influencing factors. 
This review article thereby tries to bridge a portion of this gap by proposing a framework to 
answer the question of which factors influence the success of BMI and in which way? To 
achieve this, after a brief literature review, the propositions arising from prior theoretical 
and empirical research are developed to support the proposed framework. The paper, in the 
final section, draws the conclusion and recommends several ideas for future research.  
Brief review of the recent literature on business model innovation 
A common starting point to define the concept of business model innovation (BMI) is to spell 
out the business model (BM) concept first (Chesbrough, 2007), which cannot be easily 
distinguished from similar terms such as strategy (Teece, 2010), business plan (Ghezzi et al., 
2015), or financial model (Stampfl et al., 2013). More recent definitions of BM recognise its 
conceptual, rather than financial nature (Teece, 2010), stressing the notion that BM is not 
only about revenue generation, but should comprehensively describe the way the firm 
creates, delivers, and captures value. Accordingly, drawing from recent literature, BM can be 
defined as a conceptual tool describing the logic of the business (Casadesus-Masanell and 
Ricart, 2010), a particular configuration (Jabłoński, 2015) of the content, structure, and 
scope of activities (Zott and Amit, 2010), the external network of relationships (Zott et al., 
2011), how to create value for stakeholders (Casadesus-Masanell and Ricart, 2010), which 
markets to enter and which class of customers to target (Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010), 
what to offer to the targeted customers (Zott et al., 2011), how to deliver the offerings to 
customers (Zott and Amit, 2010), and how to maximise benefit from the created value 
(Stampfl et al., 2013).  
A commonly applied systematic approach to narrowing BM definition is the 
identification of its elements or building blocks. From the early works (Mahadevan, 2000) to 
the most recent ones (Arbussa et al., 2017), scholars find it of advantage to point out the 
dimensions of BM. The variety in number and nature of the proposed elements however is 

 
NBM@Graz2017

high. It ranges from the three-dimensional framework of Mahadevan (2000) with value, 
revenue, and logistical streams, to Alt and Zimmermann (2001)’s six-dimensional 
categorisation with mission, structure, processes, revenues, legal issues, and technology, 
and the nine-dimensional classification by Osterwalder and Pigneur (2010), presented in the 
famous business model canvas that includes customer segments, customer relationships, 
value propositions, distribution channels, key resources, activities, and partnerships, and 
revenue and costs structures.  
A review of the BM literature, especially recent contributions, reveals that innovation is 
one of, if not the, most frequently discussed and researched topics introduced into the BM 
domain. Although a consensus on its definition and conceptualisation has not yet been 
reached (Planing, In Press; Spieth and Schneider, 2016), a considerable number of BMI 
definitions are anchored in two underlying principles, viz. the importance of value and the 
change in one or more elements of the firm’s BM. Frankenberger et al. (2013), for instance, 
define BMI as “a novel way of how to create and capture value, which is achieved through a 
change of one or multiple components in the business model” (p. 253). Following this school 
of thought, therefore, BMI practices lie in changing one or multiple BM value-based 
components, including value creation which addresses the production processes and the 
reconfiguration of the required resources and capabilities; value proposition, the 
products/services offered to customers; value delivery that explains the way to reach and 
interact with customers; and value capture describing how a firm deals with its financial 
issues to gain maximum profits.

Conceptual framework and proposition development 
Firms engage in innovation activities in pursuance of competitive advantages, 
differentiation, and financial benefits (Baregheh et al., 2009) that are recognised as certain 
aspects of business success (Škapa and Klapalová, 2012). A review of the BMI literature 
reveals the tendency to study the success of implementing this type of innovation from 
various viewpoints. The conceptual framework proposed in this study tries to highlight the 
importance of the key capabilities required to effectively implement BMI. Further, the 
perceived influence of the environment in terms of the extent of stability, transparency, 
uncertainty, and change is proposed to be included in the framework. As depicted in Figure 
1, the framework entails three antecedents of successful BMI together with the moderating 
effect of environmental dynamism. The following sections discuss the propositions 
associated with the dynamic capabilities-BMI relations. 
 
Figure 1. Conceptual framework 
Knowledge management capability as preceding the success of BMI 
The design and implementation of a new BM is always linked to the creation of new 
knowledge (Malhotra, 2001). The adoption of a new, different way of doing business 
potentially comes with new experiences and the feedback derived from those lessons 
increases the level of knowledge. Since knowledge acquisition is viewed as a key 
determinant of performance in various areas, such as product innovation (Song et al., 2005), 
proactiveness (firm’s ability to anticipate demands and seize new opportunities ahead of the 
competition) (Li et al., 2010), or operational performance (Zhang et al., 2016), the subject of 
its impact on successful BMI is worth studying, especially given that BMI has been discussed 
rigorously from the knowledge management point of view (See, for more details, Week, 
2000). 
Studying BMI through an organisational learning lens, scholars argue how learning 
processes affect BMI. Knowledge management capability is defined as the firm’s ability to 
acquire, assimilate, retain, protect, transfer, and put into practice the knowledge, derived 
either from external sources or generated internally (Lee and Tsai, 2006; Pérez-López and 
Alegre, 2012). A more detailed review of the literature reveals the importance of knowledge 
to implementing each dimension of BMI. In accord with Song et al. (2005), knowledge 
application is essential to ensure the success of new product development practices (value 
proposition innovation). Svetlik et al. (2007) suggest that the effective integration of new

processes into organisational culture and structure (value creation innovation) depends 
highly on the effectiveness of knowledge sharing across the management hierarchy, so that 
a better interaction between employees and managers enhances firm innovation capability. 
Soliman and Youssef (2001) advocate the role of new knowledge-based technologies in 
making delivery systems smarter and consequently, increasing customers’ satisfaction. In 
Braganza and Ward (2001)’s study, devising new ways of delivering products/services (value 
delivery innovation) is recognised as one of the facets of strategic innovation which is 
influenced by retaining the knowledge of people within the organisation. As discussed by 
Teece (2006), to better capture value from innovative efforts, it is necessary to protect 
intellectual property, as to prevent the imitation of new products or processes. This way, the 
profit generated from those innovations is more likely to be sustained as competitors find it 
more difficult to react in time. New knowledge may also arise out of BMI. Sosna et al. (2010) 
find that the design and testing of a new BM (the exploitation phase) coincides with the 
generation of new knowledge through trial-and-error learning. Afterwards, the 
implementation of a new BM (the exploitation phase) paves the way to integrating new 
knowledge into organisational climate and culture. 
On the basis of the discussion provided above, the following proposition is offered: 
Proposition 1: Firms with better knowledge management capability are more likely to 
achieve performance enhancing BMI. 
Organisational agility as preceding the success of BMI 
In an organisational context, the term “agility” refers to the firm’s ability to rapidly and easily 
move or change in response to market turbulence and uncertainty (Sherehiy et al., 2007). 
The most important characteristics of agile organisations are identified as flexibility, market 
sensitiveness, responsiveness, information drive, speed, lean structure, openness to change, 
process integration, and customised products/services (Agarwal et al., 2006; Sherehiy et al., 
2007). The positive effect of agility on performance is well and extensively documented. 
Agile enterprises are quick to respond, proactively flexible and open to innovation, leading 
them to improve firm performance in terms of sales, profits, or assets and market share 
(DeGroote and Marx, 2013).  
Schneider and Spieth (2013), in a systematic review of BMI literature, recommend 
studying the potential linkages between strategic agility and BMI as a promising future 
research field. In their view, to innovate the BM, it is crucial to foresee what environmental 
changes are likely to affect the business, so as to suppress any harmful effects and anticipate 
opportunities. Even though agility is less studied in BMI literature, the underlying 
interconnections can be detected. As a classic study on BMI, Chesbrough (2010) addresses 
“the need for firms to have strategic agility if they are to be able to transform their business 
models in the pursuit of strategic innovation” (p. 361). Highlighting “successful BM renewal 
and transformation as being one of the main outcomes of strategic agility” (p. 371), Doz and 
Kosonen (2010)_ENREF_19 argue that strategic sensitivity, leadership unity and resource 
fluidity (as three dimensions of agility), enhance the firm’s ability to either implement a new 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
267 
BM, or switch between parallel BMs. Bucherer et al. (2012) identify agility and 
responsiveness as elements promoting BMI. Proposing market adaptability as one of the 
enablers of BMI, Berman et al. (2012) assert that agile companies, thanks to their ability to 
swiftly respond to varied and unpredictable customer demands, are better positioned to 
generate new BMs in order to exploit new markets and opportunities.  
Organisational agility can be reflected in the BM itself. The concept of agile BMs is 
echoed in the manufacturing systems literature, concerning the value creation dimension of 
BM. As posited by Loss and Crave (2011), under an agile and dynamic BM, the firm is more 
likely to extract information from external resources, in particular customers. If this 
translates into customer satisfaction, financial performance improvement can also be 
expected. Hyland and Beckett (2005) also conclude that agile BMs accelerate the exchange 
of information among supply chain members.  
Proposition 2: Agile organisations are more likely to achieve performance enhancing BMI and 
develop agile BMs. 
Business model ambidexterity as preceding the success of BMI 
Intense competition and unpredictable market preferences in today’s business environment 
compel firms to base their decision-making processes upon customers’ demands (Lee and 
Tsai, 2006). Heavy reliance on customers’ preferences, however, can be of major 
disadvantage especially when the company is not able to quickly and easily adapt to new 
demands. This brings to the fore the relative ability to meet the conflicting needs of 
customers. In some situations, for instance, companies should supply customers who 
demand certain low-cost products or services. Other situations, however, cause an increased 
demand for higher-cost offerings that are of higher quality. Organisations competing with 
dual strategies are more likely to fulfil such conflicting demands.  
Ever since Duncan (1976) introduced the idea of designing dual organisational 
structures, scholars have been extending the concept into other domains. BM ambidexterity, 
as one of the outcomes of such efforts, addresses the advantages of being able to perform 
under dual BMs. One of the assumptions of the ambidexterity theory is that the firm’s 
sustainable growth hinges upon its ability to simultaneously exploit existing capabilities and 
explore new ones (Raisch et al., 2009). BM ambidexterity, in a similar vein, can be described 
as the ability to leverage the resources and competencies under the current BM, while at the 
same time seizing new opportunities under a new BM. As summarised in Table 1, Markides 
(2013) proposes two major aspects of ambidexterity through which the BMI literature can 
be advanced.

It is crucial sometimes to exploit a

and change it later to a different one which 
was designed and prepared beforehand.  
Contextual 
ambidexterity 
To better promote 
ambidexterity among staff, a 
suitable organisational context 
and structure should first be 
defined and implemented. 
To achieve BM ambidexterity, a flexible, 
open to change structure is required to 
deal with issues of authority, 
communications, roles, power, and 
responsibilities in handling divergent BMs. 
 
BM ambidexterity is often viewed as a key capability to improve BMI. Chesbrough 
(2010) underlines the value of the ability to simultaneously monitor the environment 
(external concentration) and reallocate internal resources for successful implementation of 
new BMs. Probing into the effect of using parallel BMs on research-based spin-offs’ 
innovativeness, Clausen and Rasmussen (2013) argue that they are more likely to thrive if 
developing a different BM from their mother company and performing under both BMs 
simultaneously. Velu and Stiles (2013) point to the cannibalisation as one of the obstacles to 
BMI, so that the introduction of a new BM might potentially diminish the value of the 
existing one. They therefore suggest developing the ability to organise parallel BMs as a 
remedy to the challenge of changing the BM.  
Proposition 3: Firms with business model ambidexterity are more likely to achieve 
performance enhancing BMI. 
Environmental dynamism as moderating the dynamic capabilities-BMI 
relationships 
The firm’s competitive environment has been largely argued to be of fundamental 
importance in determining innovation success (Simerly and Li, 2000). Employing different 
perspectives, scholars justify the importance of environment. Taking the resource-based 
view of the firm, Sirmon et al. (2007) assert that the environment and its features determine 
the type of resources needed the most. For instance, they find that in environments with 
higher information asymmetry (the extent to which the market players have private 
information), knowledge-based resources are of greater significance. Drawing on the social 
network theory, Li and Liu (2014), argue that since altered dynamic environments make it 
more difficult for firms to gain resources, those with strong social network ties are more 
likely to survive and thrive. Reviewing the literature on the influence of environmental 
contingencies, it is commonplace to come across articles emphasising the importance of 
environmental dynamism, seen as the extent to which the business environment is instable, 
uncertain, changing, and volatile (Li and Simerly, 2002). The degree of dynamism mostly 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
269 
stems from the level of information transparency defined by the players of the market 
(Sirmon et al., 2007).  
Even since the seminal work of Burns and Stalker (1961), the influence of environmental 
dynamism on firm success has been the focus of management scholars, and has been widely 
recognised as moderating the relationship between different concepts (e.g., structure (Burns 
and Stalker, 2000), strategy (McArthur and Nystrom, 1991), or firm ownership (Li and 
Simerly, 1998)) and performance. For Burns & Stalker (1961), the level of dynamism in the 
external environment dictates different organisational structures: the mechanistic structure 
with bureaucratic, hierarchical, and centralised decision-making systems, is more suited for 
stable environments, whereas the organic structure, that entails more flexible and 
decentralised management systems, accommodates better the demands of changeable 
environments (Burns and Stalker, 1961).  
As indicated in the literature, “the use (and usefulness) of dynamic capabilities is greater 
in dynamic environments” (Zahra et al., 2006p. 923). As such, dynamic capabilities are more 
likely to generate and maintain competitive advantages in changing environments (Li and 
Liu, 2014). Having said that and in the context of innovativeness, it is surmised that certain 
capabilities are conducive to innovation attainment, especially in dynamic environments. 
Knowledge-based capabilities, for instance, are viewed as critically important in enhancing 
performance when the environment is highly changeable (Miller and Shamsie, 1996). Jiao et 
al. (2013) demonstrate the positive moderating impact of environmental dynamism on the 
relationship between dynamic capabilities and organisational change. Opportunity-sensing 
(one of the identified dynamic capabilities in their study), as they argue, is highly dependent 
on knowledge acquisition from the environment. Organisational agility, as another dynamic 
capability, is conceptualised as the capability of changing when uncertainty is high and is 
seen as improving the product innovation processes (Fliedner and Vokurka, 1997). The 
relationship between dynamic capabilities and competitive advantages become stronger, 
therefore,  in turbulent environments  and frequent innovative practices are key competitive 
advantages in such environments (Li and Liu, 2014). The above discussion can be also 
applied to BM ambidexterity. The literature on ambidexterity is well positioned to address 
the competitive features of the environment: “the more dynamic the firm’s environment, 
the higher the likelihood of ambidexterity” (O’Reilly and Tushman, 2008p. 196). In line with 
Koen et al. (2011), ambidextrous organisations are generally better able to implement BMI 
by virtue of their managers’ leadership skills at handling conflicting, disparate circumstances. 
Therefore, in the light of the above discussions, it can be suggested that dynamic capabilities 
are more likely to drive BMI in changing environments.  
Proposition 4: Environmental dynamism positively moderates the relationship between 
dynamic capabilities and BMI.

Conclusion and future research 
Our purpose in this study was to identify key factors influencing the success of BMI. Having 
conducted a literature review, we found the perception that three dynamic capabilities, viz. 
knowledge management, organisational agility, and BM ambidexterity enhance the firm’s 
ability to innovate its BM. In addition, we propose that environmental dynamism moderates 
the dynamic capabilities-BMI relationships, such that these relationships are stronger in 
dynamic than in stable environments.  
Given the proposed conceptual framework, this study contributes to the BMI literature 
in at least three ways. First, it stresses the importance of studying BMI from the dynamic 
capabilities perspective. Second, it incorporates three antecedents of successful BMI 
implementation, highlighting the need to further explore the dynamic capabilities required 
to implement successful BMI strategies. Finally, the moderating influences of environmental 
dynamism are weighted supporting the premise that environment is a key concept when 
studying innovation.  
Future research is suggested to, first and foremost, empirically examine and verify the 
relationships proposed in the current study, namely the effects of knowledge management, 
organisational agility, and BM ambidexterity on BMI implementation, as well as the 
moderating 
influence 
of 
environmental 
dynamism 
on 
dynamic 
capabilities-BMI 
relationships. Second, qualitative research is recommended to identify the other critical 
success factors in the implementation of BMI. Taking the resource-based view of the firm, 
social network perspective, and performance frameworks might be of help in doing so.

New business models in the Nordic wood 
construction towards 2030

Introduction and purpose 
New sustainability driven innovations are clearly needed to renew traditional sectors of 
economy into bioeconomy. Stimulating collaboration between agile and new niches (start-
ups and SMEs) and more risk-aversive large-scale incumbent firms is needed to break free 
from existing strong silos. The rise of wooden multistory construction (WMC) in the Nordic 
countries has turned out to be the most evident new business opportunity in the emerging 
bioeconomy. Also according to Bosman and Rotmans (2016), in the Finnish national level 
transition to bioeconomy, bio-built environment based on wooden buildings and 
construction materials is among the four key activities. However, there is a lack of business 
model related innovations in bioeconomy, especially from service development point of 
view (Hansen 2016), which emphasizes the need to better understand both how value is 
created and the roles various parties within and outside the firm play in it. 
Previous literature on business models in construction sector is quite extensive (see or a 
review by Mokhlesian and Holmen 2012). However, regarding the specific viewpoint of 
renewable wood based construction, there is a very scarce literature combining business 
model perspective to the wood building sector as a holistic view on how companies do 
business. In order to differentiate between strategic and operational effectiveness, Brege et 
al. (2014) focused on market position, system offering and operational platform are key 
business model blocks in the Swedish house-building sector. Using a case study approach, 
they found five business model elements to be important for WMC: prefabrication mode, 
actor roles in the building process, end-user segments, system augmentation and the use of 
complementary resources. In a follow-up study on two case companies, Lessing and Brege 
(2015) found that the use of end-customer knowledge to identify target segment, 
development of an offering and sequentially increasing control over the production and 
value chain would be a recipe for success in construction business development.  
In a conceptual study by Pelli (2016), when relying on Service-Dominant-Logic (SDL, 
Vargo and Lusch 2016), buildings were perceived as service platforms or built environment 
was integrated with built natural environment. A partnership model, in which construction 
participants work together as an integrated, collaborative team with joint management

structure under multi-party contractual arrangements of project partnering, alliancing and 
integrated delivery has also in recent years gained growing interest and used in analyzing the 
Finnish market (Lahdenperä 2012).  
In this paper, we combine business model literature to the SDL as a platform to analyze 
the changing WMC business and the involved value networks towards 2030 using data from 
Finland and Sweden. Methodologically the study uses three round Delphi process conducted 
in 2016-17among construction value chain professionals in Finland and Sweden.  
Conceptual background 
According to Vargo and Lusch (2008), Service Dominant Logic essentially builds upon “the 
application of competences for the benefit of customers; customers are operant resources, 
rather than operand resources, and they can contribute as value co-creators to the service 
process”. For the S-D logic to renew the traditional  industries like forest or construction 
business (Toppinen et al., 2013) would require the users and consumers to be more actively 
involved in the development process of the products or services.  
Teece (2010) describes a firm business model as how it converts resources and 
capabilities into economic output, i.e. creates, captures and delivers value. Business model 
and company strategy are two constructs that bear close connection, and some scholar have 
even used the terms interchangeably (Magretta 2002). In a famous Osterwalder et al. (2005) 
conceptualization of business model, there are nine elements under four pillars: product, 
customer interface, infrastructure management and financial aspects and are in empirical 
world approach using tools like business model canvas.  
In a systematic literature review, Mokhlesian and Holmen (2012) analysed 38 studies on 
business models for the greening construction sector using the nine elements from 
Osterwalder et al al. (2005). They found that the most important elements that facilitate 
change towards green construction practices falling under the pillar infrastructure 
management are capability, partner networks and value configuration. Based on this, we will 
also focus in our empirical analysis on these same elements, although it is important to note 
that they are interconnected with each other and the other six elements present in 
Osterwalder et al. (2005) as well (see Table 1).

Data and methodology 
Data collected with a three stage expert Delphi during 2016-17 was used to elicitate 
perceptions on sustainable business model innovations related to WMC. Our dissensus-
based Delphi approach consisted of both thematic interviews (Rounds 1 and 3, altogether 18 
+ 16 interviews) and an online survey (Round 2, 17 respondents). The panelists involved in 
our study were of Finnish and Swedish origin, and they were required to have in-depth 
knowledge of the usage of wood in multistory construction in the Nordic region. The 
Swedish data was a smaller proportion and used mostly to benchmark Finnish perspectives. 
The panel composition is given in Appendix. 
In the first round data, this study focuses on the structure and cooperation of the wood 
construction value chain, but in the interviews also overall state of the wood industries, raw 
material and end-use market issues and role of sustainable development were discussed. In 
the second Delphi round, the emphasis was given to the themes and topics that were seen 
as the most thought provoking or controversial in the first phase, and the questionnaire 
consisted of 42 closed-ended questions, of which we again focus on business development 
related items. The data from Round 3, which was built upon on previous rounds, deepened 
understanding on particularly  the business model development. The data was analysed 
using qualitative methods (thematisation) and simple descriptive statistics.

Tentative results 
Partner network  
During the first round interviews, it became obvious that the current co-operational 
schemes and the future direction of this is the most complex and difficult topic to panellists. 
In general, the most experienced in prior co-operative efforts were the respondents who 
had worked at larger companies. For example, one respondent who worked at a large 
processor was familiar with working with builders, planners and architects. Respondents 
from smaller processors were also used to working with architects, but from the more 
further upstream the respondents were from the end users, the less they seemed to actively 
co-operate.  
What should be noted is that the builders were interested in offering their expertise, 
and already did utilize it in co-operation with the solution providers when bringing the 
validated products into market. Networked structures, co-operation with competitors, the 
necessity of standards, issues with the complexity and time consuming nature of 
construction projects, large operators taking control of a bigger part of the value chain, 
hybrid building, online marketplaces, and even competing ecosystems within the WMC were 
all mentioned, but with little coherence between the respondents. “It could be [that in the 
future] we will see competitors as partners. One manufactures the walls and the other 
manufactures the flooring.” Executive at a processor, 22 years of experience, Finland;  “It is 
more and more important to find strategic alliances” Executive at a processor, 11 years of 
experience, Sweden 
Furthermore, the respondents did see co-operation as an important factor in the future, 
however their views differed largely on how and with whom it should be undertaken. 
Smaller, and more local operators were more prone to discuss networked models, in which 
they co-operate with other small operators. For the respondents that worked at larger 
organizations, the concept of hybrid-building solutions seemed interesting, as well for the 
respondents that represented smaller builders. However, the co-operation between the 
wood construction sector and for example concrete solution providers was also challenged 
by some respondents due to for example different optimum dimensions and because of the 
on-going ‘wood vs. concrete’ rhetoric. Examples from respondents from both countries 
illustrate this well:“I don’t think the co-operation [with concrete] will happen – there is just 
too much competition” Executive at a processor, 11 years of experience, Sweden; “The way 
construction has been developed by concrete builders for the past 50 years is not optimal for 
wood construction. We should get the optimal of our material out.” Executive at a processor, 
5 years of experience, Finland

Based on Round 2, there was a strong faith in organizational co-operation between 
different types of players, while the topics that divided opinions most commonly were: 
“Concrete builders will be significantly more interested in the opportunities offered by 
wooden building solutions than today” and “By 2030, the amount of companies involved in 
the wood construction value chain will be much higher than today”.

The key findings from Round 3 emphasized the need to increase quality and availability 
of new business solution to WMC. Respondent voiced hope for getting new players to the 
market and to add more competition among large-scale construction businesses and 
improve quality of construction.   
Furthermore, good examples on newly established alliance structures among different 
types of players were brought up, e.g. wood-material based new hospital project under 
construction in Kainuu in Finland. Overall, the health benefits from natural materials and 
indoor quality issues in public buildings were seen as a stronger driver towards future 
diffusion of WMC especially, but maintaining cost competitiveness is still elementary. 
Addressing health impacts in industrial construction business with the use of renewal 
materials seems to be a more instrumental channel for the uptake of wood than intrinsic 
motivation towards sustainability among key construction value network actors.  
Capability 
During the first round interviews, the development of more sophisticated building solutions 
was seen as a capital demanding process for which only a few of the biggest operators have 
the necessary resources. Builders, especially the ones that build with a range of different 
materials were not interested in developing the solutions, and would rather only be 
interested in bringing them to the markets. This is further illustrated by the quote below: 
“We will not do this validation [of wood based building solutions], that needs to be 
undertaken by the wood industry itself.” Executive at a builder company, 26 years of 
experience, Finland. This kind of attitude would seem to indicate limited interest in acting in 
a role of resource integrator in line with Vargo and Lusch (2008). 
Differing timespans on which operators in the value chain plan their actions as well as the 
resources that different organizations have to develop building solutions based on wood 
were cited as key issues in co-operation on several accounts. Respondents also identified an 
issue with the timespan being the length of a single project. “[Building] processes can be very 
long, even unbearably so.” Research manager at a forestry expert organization, 15 years of 
experience, Finland

In the second round, necessary core competencies were approached using the claims listed 
in Table 3. Based on it, there was highest conformity for an item “a building process from 
start to finish will be significantly shorter than today”. Statement “Small companies will lack 
the money and knowhow to develop more competitive and advanced wooden building 
solutions” was perceived with low desirability but higher likelihood.

Furthermore, in the Round 3, the availability of skilled personnel was still found as a 
bottleneck among few respondents while others felt this is not an issue, but further analysis 
is needed to connect this capability dimesion. 
Value configuration 
As the future of the value chain, especially how the actors view the operating logic of it is the 
key point of interest in this study, many of the statements the respondents were faced with 
in the second phase of the Delphi process had to do with these aspects. Likelihood and 
desirability of related claims are given in Table 4. According to it, there was highest 
conformity for an item “by 2030, prefabrication will be the main operating logic, with less on 
site building”. Instead, item “Best business model is to control a bigger part of value chain 
than today” divided opinions, both in terms of likelihood and desirability. more in depth 
analysis is yet lacking on the Round 3 results regarding value configuration.

Conclusions 
In line with Brege et al. (2014), key aspects that were emphasized (under his system 
offering) were cost competitiveness, prefabrication and the role of hybrid building solutions, 
as well as to some extent the perceived role of wood in combatting climate change. Under 
the market position, our expert panelists brought up the level of standardisation and 
regulation, the role of public procurement in piloting solutions and making wood more 
visible in built environment. Urbanization was emphasized to be a big driver for multi-story 
construction in both countries. Early involvement of wood as a key material solution in the 
city planning phase of a building project was therefore found to be crucial. From the 
viewpoint of operational platform, our results highlighted the complementarity of resources 
as a long-term partnership among developers, architects, material providers were brought 
up as a key issue, and the question arises which organization acts as a resource integrator. In 
a study by Brege et al (2014) in Sweden, picture was seen more diverse: some firms are 
capable of doing designer planning by themselves, or new more multi-skilled entrants to 
construction business are entering, which changes the roles and responsibilities in the value 
network.  
Our results illustrate only to some extent scope for changing business models towards 
wood material based multistory solutions and addressing sustainability any other than very 
instrumental way Competition from new players entering the industrial construction market, 
and collaboration between WMC and traditional concrete-based construction businesses are 
among key topics that need to be analysed in more depth in future research, in addition to 
formation of alliance models.

Abstract 
This paper sheds light on the process and mechanisms of disruptive technological change 
and the impact on business model innovation. Considering the specific characteristics of 
disruptive technologies, their influence on different elements of business models and 
especially on the process of business model innovation is examined. To better understand 
how technology shifts drive business model innovation we take exploratory interviews with 
high technology companies situated in multiple branches. Together with a literature analysis 
we get insight into the intersection of technology and business model. 
Introduction 
Throughout history, successful firms have often experimented with new technologies to 
forestall their replacement by new firms (Tushman, O'Reilly 1996). While some firms in 
mature industries have successfully managed this transformation (Bergek et al. 2013), 
research has demonstrated many examples of how incumbent firms encounter severe 
difficulties when facing radical technology change (Utterback 1994, Tushman, O'Reilly 1996). 
Disruptive technological developments and technology shifts therefore are among the most 
lethal threats to any successful business. However, if these new technologies develop, new 
entrants tend to outcompete established firms, which often fail to respond in time to the 
threat from such disruptive innovations (Christensen 1997). 
Technology shifts replace existing technologies of incumbents by sacrificing features 
that are important to current customers and offering different attributes (Bower, 
Christensen 1995), and change the performance metrics along which firms compete 
(Danneels 2004). Technological innovations therefore increasingly influence the 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
288 
transformation of business models. As technological innovations are influencing business 
model´s development (Baden-Fuller, Haefliger 2013), it is important to understand how 
disruptive technologies drive business model innovation (Tongur, Engwall 2014). 
In recent years, several studies have emphasized that problems with radical 
technological change are often related to business model inertia. The fundamental challenge 
of disruptive technologies is a business model problem, not a technology problem, meaning 
that the key challenge of technology shifts lies in the interaction between technological 
development and business model innovation (Markides 2006). However, while a new 
business model can be crucial to commercializing and capturing the value of a technological 
innovation (Chesbrough, Rosenbloom 2002, Teece 2010), an existing business model can 
also constitute a lock-in that hinders technology shifts (Tripsas, Gavetti 2000). 
However, in spite of recent strides forward in the understanding of the drivers, 
processes, and catalyzers of business model change, there is still little knowledge of how 
firms adapt their business models in response to external threats and opportunities (Saebi et 
al. 2016, Battistella et al. 2017). The long-standing challenge posed by Chesbrough (2010), 
who asks when a novel technology requires a novel business model, and when the 
combination of a novel technology and novel business model lead to competitive advantage 
is still not answered sufficiently. 
Theoretical Background 
Technology Shifts: sustaining and disruptive Technologies 
Technological change is critically important to firms for several reasons. First, it has the 
potential to obsolete assets, labour, and intellectual capital of incumbents in the market. 
Second, it can create entirely new markets, with new products, new customers, and 
exploding demand. Third, technological evolution enables firms to target new segments 
within a market with improved products. Fourth, and most importantly, incumbents often 
misinterpret the potential impact of the new technology, and this error causes their demise 
(Sood, Tellis 2011). 
The failure of firms in the face of technological change has been a topic of intense 
research and debate in the strategy literature. An early attempt to understand this 
phenomenon was by Foster (1986). He posited the theory of S-curves, which suggested that 
technologies evolve along successive S-curves. Incumbents fail if they miss to switch to a 
new technology that passes the incumbent’s technology in performance. Tushman and 
Anderson (1986) refined this theory by distinguishing between competence-enhancing and 
competence-destroying technological changes. They argued that failure occurred only when 
the new technology destroyed, rather than enhanced, the expertise of the incumbents. 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
289 
Other researchers built on the theory of punctuated equilibrium to propose a demand-side 
explanation for the phenomenon of disruption (e.g. Levinthal 1998, Adner 2002). They 
suggested that disruption occurs when a new technology that starts in one domain moves to 
a new domain with potentially higher demand and additional resources. Christensen (1997) 
proposed the theory of disruptive innovations. It posited that disruption occurred when an 
initially inferior technology introduced by a new entrant improved to meet the needs of the 
mass market (Bower, Christensen 1995). 
At the firm level, the challenge of managing displacement threats has often been 
attributed to an unwillingness to cannibalize existing technology investments, organizational 
inertia, and the inability to adopt the necessary skills needed to engage in the new 
technology (Adner 2002). Closer examination of technology competition, however, reveals 
that technology transitions are not necessarily due to the incumbent technology’s inherent 
limits, the new technology’s ability to provide superior performance, or incumbents’ inability 
to master new skills. While these factors are important, numerous cases of innovative 
incumbents who did not suffer from these handicaps, yet nonetheless mismanaged the 
challenge of technological transition (Adner 2002).  
According to the level of newness disruptive technologies can be distinguished from 
sustaining technologies (Christensen 1997): (1) Sustaining technologies improve the 
performance of established products measured against criteria customers and competitors 
are used to assess. Examples of such criteria in the context of motor vehicles include engine 
power or range. (2) Disruptive technologies underperform established products in terms of 
the traditional performance criteria. However, they provide other benefits (e.g. a car´s CO2 
footprint). These features do generally not attract interest within the existing mainstream 
markets, but are valued by a few fringe customers.  
While sustaining technologies serve the needs of most customers, and are improved 
along the trajectory valued by mainstream customers, disruptive technologies take on a 
different trajectory as they diffuse in the marketplace. Therefore, as a basic characteristic, 
disruptive technologies lead to a shift in value-creation giving rise to new market segments 
(Amshoff et al. 2015). Typically, disruptive technologies are often cheaper and inferior in 
performance, yet they involve features that may provide competitive advantage in the 
future (Rao et al. 2006).  
The disruption in the term “disruptive technologies” is not an attribute of technology. 
Rather, it describes the effect that some technologies appear to have on markets affected by 
technology-based innovation and the frequent downturn in the success of major firms that 
compete in those markets when they fail to adopt the new technology in a timely way. It is a 
disruption in the business model: what do we sell; how do we make it; how do we sell, 
distribute and support it; to whom; and against whom? It often is accompanied by a 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
290 
disruption in the fortunes of firms using the old business model, because they, and often 
their customers, fail to recognize that new needs are driving the business (Paap, Katz 2004). 
The most influential expression of a demand-side role in technology competition has 
been Christensen’s examination of disruptive technologies. Disruptive technologies are 
technologies that introduce a different performance package from mainstream technologies 
and are inferior to mainstream technologies along the dimensions of performance that are 
most important to mainstream customers. As such, in their early development they only 
serve niche segments that value their nonstandard performance attributes. Subsequently, 
further development raises the disruptive technology’s performance on the focal 
mainstream attributes to a level sufficient to satisfy mainstream customers. While improved, 
the performance of the disruptive technology remains inferior to the performance offered 
by the established mainstream technology, which itself is improving as well. Technology 
disruption occurs when, despite its inferior performance on focal attributes, the new 
technology displaces the mainstream technology from the mainstream market. Christensen 
plots the performance-provided and performance-demanded trajectories for different 
technologies and market segments, and shows that technology disruptions occur when 
these trajectories intersect. He documents these dynamics in numerous contexts, including 
hard disk drives, earthmoving equipment, retail stores and motor controls (Christensen 
1997). 
Business Model Adaptation and Business Model Innovation 
New business models are required in order to meet the changes in the business logic. The 
main challenges in developing new business models are managing the complexity of the 
upcoming disruptive technologies and anticipating the business logics in nascent markets 
(Amshoff et al. 2015). Increasingly, the literature has been moving from conceptualizing, 
characterizing and explaining a business model at a given point in time, towards a more 
dynamic view that examines phenomena like business model innovation and adaptation 
(Saebi et al. 2016). 
Adaptation may imply changes of the firm’s value proposition, market segment, value 
chain and value-capture, or how these are linked in an architecture. Given organizational 
inertia and outcome uncertainty, firms are unlikely to change their business model unless 
they have rather strong incentives to do so. Even in cases where the need for adaptation 
seems evident, the firm’s strategic orientation and the associated path dependencies are 
likely to impede the process of adapting an existing business model to new market demands 
or competitive threats (Saebi et al. 2016). 
The difference between a pre-existing BM and a new one has also been highlighted by 
Velu (2015): the more radical is the change in the BM component the more the resulting BM 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
291 
is radical. Cavalcante et al. (2011) adopted a process-based conceptualization of BM and 
have identified four main typologies of business model change (i.e. BM creation, BM 
extension, BM revision and BM termination) and then have linked those typologies to the 
degree of innovation of the new BM. 
The strategic reconfiguration of business models is associated with many difficulties 
which need to be overcome, such as: (1) identifying change needs, (2) overcoming inertia, 
(3) accepting new structures and choosing adequate approaches to renovation (Wirtz et al. 
2010). Due to the complexity of the commercialization of emerging technologies-based 
venture, it is conceivable that the firms will go through many cycles of design of their 
business model within the entire innovation process. As recently suggested by Lubik and 
Garnsey (2016), and before by Sosna et al. (2010), emerging-technologies-based ventures 
will most likely go through a ‘trial-and-error’ process of learning to build their business 
model. Therefore, these companies will encounter many trigger points that will starts 
constant cycles of adjustments. 
Enablers and Facilitators of Business Model Innovation 
The success of a business model is naturally dependent on numerous factors such as market 
conditions, strategic synergies (or conflicts), competencies and assets, financial 
arrangements (pricing policy, revenue-sharing schemes), robust technological infrastructure, 
effective governance mechanisms and organizational design (Battistella et al. 2017). 
Whilst, according to Johnson et al. (2008), a BMI cycle happens after new knowledge is 
gained, Demil and Lecocq (2010) and Dmitriev et al. (2014), showed that the BM cycles can 
be triggered by several factors such as: the interaction between and within the BM 
components, the interactions across firm’s capabilities (e.g. market and technology) or 
inputs that come from the external firm environment. Generally, BMI triggers can be divided 
into three categories: external, internal and contextual (Demil, Lecocq 2010). Internal 
triggers can be related to the effects of decisions that can affect the organizational system 
(e.g. decisions related to outsourcing a part of production). Changes in the BM can also be 
triggered by external factors such as changes to demand, new technological advancements 
or country-dependent environmental issues (Dimitriev et al. 2014). Ultimately, the 
dynamism of a BM can be launched by contextual factors, such as the nature of an 
invention, the specific team of employees and the target market (Dimitriev et al. 2014). 
The BMI process is triggered by exogenous or endogenous factors. While for exogenous 
triggers we mean all the factors that lead, for instance, to a new market opportunity and to 
technological advancements, for endogenous triggers we refer to all the factors related to a 
cognitive perspective (Hock 2015). Building on other scholars works (e.g. Velu 2015; 
Dimitriev et al. 2014; Cavalcante et al. 2011; Demil, Lecocq 2010), in the framework one or 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
292 
more triggers initiate a BM cycle, and will influence one or more of the BM dimensions 
leading to a new BM, whose degree of innovation will vary from incremental to radical 
(Flammini et al. 2016). 
Technology as a Catalyzer of Business Model Innovation 
Technology by itself has no single objective value. The economic value of a technology 
remains latent until it is commercialized in some way via a business model. The same 
technology commercialized in two different ways will yield two different returns. In some 
instances, an innovation can successfully employ a business model already familiar to the 
firm, while, other times, a company will have a business model that can make use of the 
technology via licensing (Chesbrough 2010).  
In fast-evolving industries technological shifts have been identified as major catalyzers 
of change. Agarwal and Tripsas (2008) distinguish three stages of evolution – 
emergence/growth, shake out and maturity – and identify the technological changes that 
drive firm performance and trigger industry evolution at each stage. As industries and their 
technologies evolve, the mature industry stage is characterized by competition between 
incumbents, low firm entry and exit rates, and incremental innovations, a configuration that 
can allow for the profitable disintegration of value chains, allowing greater specialization of 
inputs and outputs that lead to improved efficiency and greater speed to market. The advent 
of further technological discontinuities at this stage may either speed the transition from 
maturity towards decline, or it may fuel a new and reinvigorating cycle, taking the industry 
back to an emergent stage (Ararwal, Tripsas 2008). At such times, when new entrants are 
trying to create and dominate nascent markets incumbents must avoid resource and routine 
rigidities. Both incumbents and new entrants will be attempting to identify correctly which 
are the industry's most strategically valuable competencies, and the value propositions that 
align best with what customers find - or will find - valuable, and make their business model 
decisions accordingly (Sabatier et al. 2012). 
When technological discontinuities are introduced into an existing industry, they 
confront an existing industrial organization, established market relationships, specifically 
developed assets, and stable and predictable collaboration patterns. Technological 
discontinuities do not change dominant industry logics until they begin to usher in different 
business models that modify asset specificities, create new dependency ties and reshape 
collaboration patterns, and thus change players' appropriation strategies, modifying the 
balance between intellectual property rights, asset specificity and bilateral collaboration. 
Even if a breakthrough technology is involved, as long as it can be integrated within the 
existing industry value chain, it will not alter the balance of power between its actors or its 
established appropriation modes. But when one of these components is affected, dominant 
industry logics may be challenged: technological discontinuities have the potential to lead to 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
293 
business model innovation and proliferation, and it is these changes that trigger the 
disruption of an industry's dominant logic (Sabatier et al. 2012). 
Methodology 
Our paper is a conceptual contribution based on a literature analysis. Additionally we 
took 16 explorative interviews with high technology companies situated in multiple branches 
in the area of Austria. Data gathering took place with the help of semi-structured interviews 
with experts in the field of business models and technology management. The interviews 
were conducted either face-to-face at the company site or via phone. All interviews were 
recorded and transcribed. From both streams – the literature analysis and the empirical 
insights – we develop a deep insight. The intersection of between technology shifts and 
business models proposed, relating the core technology of the firm to its value proposition, 
value creation, and value capture, enables further inquiry into the complex dynamics of this 
phenomenon.  
Results and Discussion 
Previous research on technology shifts has focused primarily on the changes in technology. 
By adding a business model perspective to the analysis, the challenges of incumbent firms 
facing technological discontinuities are revealed in their full range. Furthermore, while 
previous research typically applies a retrospective perspective on technology shifts, our 
contribution addresses the strategic challenges of firms facing a potential technology shift. 
In many of the classical cases of technology shifts, the incumbent companies that went out 
of business did so because they did not adapt their business models to the emerging 
competitive landscape. Our more future-oriented perspective on technology shifts reveals 
the profound difficulties incumbent firms face when addressing the uncertainties of an 
ambiguous future.  
Our findings suggest - in accordance with Tongur and Engwall (2014) - that when 
incumbent firms encounter a technology shift they also face a business model dilemma. As 
concluded by Christensen (2006: 48), the fundamental challenge of disruptive technologies 
is “a business model problem, not a technology problem”, meaning that the key challenge of 
technology shifts lies in the interaction between technological development and business 
model innovation. Because the incumbent technology offers superior performance on these 
dimensions, incumbent firms’ investments are directed towards extending the existing 
technology, rather than the (potentially) disruptive technological opportunity. Incumbents 
have an additional incentive to ignore disruptive technologies because, with their lower 
performance, they appeal to the low-end, low-profit portion of the mainstream market. In 
contrast, entrant firms, whose decisions are not constrained by an existing customer base 
and whose technology offers inferior performance on the focal mainstream dimensions, are 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
294 
forced to identify consumers who value the new features offered by the new technology and 
support its further development. Firms are not by definition paralyzed by the new 
technology through their established customers, but have the option of preparing an 
appropriate strategic response. The business model dilemma illustrated above is a profound 
strategic problem that, if left unsolved, risks holding back necessary radical changes within 
the firm's value proposition, value creation, and value capture processes. However, while a 
new business model can be crucial to commercializing and capturing the value of a 
technological innovation, an existing business model can also constitute a lock-in that 
hinders technology shifts.  
We agree with Sabatier et al. (2012) that business model innovations follow 
technological innovation - and when they appear (even following quite minor technological 
innovations) they introduce new logics into the industry. Disruptive technologies often 
create new markets, which obey entirely different rules (Amshoff et al. 2015). They 
sometimes have a radical nature, and are exploited via a technology-push effort (i.e. when 
an innovation is driven by advancements in science, or where the technology and 
applications are the drivers). The commercialization of radical emerging technologies can 
happen also through a technology-market coupling strategy (Flammini et al. 2016). When 
business model innovations follow major technological breakthroughs, a delay is required 
before the technology can be set up and specific assets and capabilities built and deployed, 
during which time established value chains prove adaptable enough to accommodate 
emerging innovative technologies.  
During the first phase after new technologies are introduced, the discontinuities they 
represent are not enough to induce major changes in the industry or to usher in a new logic: 
the industry logic remains as it was, and new ventures participate in value creation within 
existing value chain structures. Our findings argue (in line with Sabatier et al. 2012) that the 
early stages of the introduction of technological discontinuities - which are often 
characterized by technological uncertainty due to competition, both between new 
technologies and between them and existing technologies - are less favorable to business 
model innovation. 
The survival or death of incumbents is not only due to the competence enhancing or 
destroying character of technological discontinuities - in fact, during this first phase, 
technological breakthroughs seem to have reinforced incumbents' positions in this industry. 
Even in the presence of major technological changes, while business models remain similar, 
the logic of the industry remains unchanged. But, when actors - by themselves or via 
alliances - are powerful enough to promote new business models offering new value 
propositions and working via new value chains, the dominant logic is challenged, and 
evolves.

Dominant logics are disrupted by the arrival of business models from other industry 
sectors, when large diversified entrants enter the market. At the same time these 
discontinuities which enable new technologies that disrupt dominant logics, create 
opportunities for new products and process, and thus fuel new business models. When 
technological discontinuities come from start-ups, the dominant logic of the industry evolves 
slowly - when they are supported by diversified entrants, we can expect faster and more 
radical change in dominant logics. 
Conclusion 
This paper aims to summarize the process and mechanisms of disruptive technological 
change and to discuss the impact on business model innovation. Considering the specific 
characteristics of disruptive technologies, their influence on different elements of business 
models and especially on the process of business model innovation is examined. 
The paper therefore inquires into the dynamics of the intersection between technology 
and business models. The business model framework proposed, relating the core technology 
of the firm to its value proposition, value creation, and value capture, enables further inquiry 
into the complex dynamics of this phenomenon. It reveals why technology shifts are so 
difficult to master and suggests that discontinuous innovation is not about either 
technological innovation in order to gain a viable business model, but is instead a compound 
of both. The critical challenge for a company facing a technology shift is overcoming the 
technology shift as such, while simultaneously crafting a business model matching the 
unknown competitive context after the shift. Our research hence is addressing the 
interrelationship between technological and business model innovation after a technology 
shift occurs.

Abstract 
The understanding of the relationship between sustainable technologies and business 
models is only at its beginning. Therefore, this paper investigates the influence of 
technologies on business models using literature and empirical data. Based on this 
investigation a generic model of the influence of technologies on business models is 
established. The established model is used to discuss the influence of the potentially 
sustainable technology of the fuel cell in the automotive industry. Subsequently, changes in 
business model elements as well as factors responsible for these changes are identified.

Introduction 
Technologies have proven to influence a firm’s ability to compete in the market. New 
technologies represent strategic resources with the potential of growth. However, they also 
threaten companies which base their success on outdated technologies (Klappert 2006, 
Klappert et al. 2011).  
Many successful innovations of business models are based on technological 
developments (Vorbach et al. 2017, Gassmann et al. 2013). Relevant aspects according to 
Chesbrough (2007) are the influence of technological shifts on a firm’s mechanism to create 
and capture value as well as its position in the value chain. Drivers for this innovation may be 
due to exterior changes (e.g. changes in technology, regulations, customer needs) or come 
from the company itself. In that regard one has to keep in mind that the successful 
implementation of technological innovation requires appropriate business models (Teece 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
300 
2010). Therefore, technology is not the only, but one of the most relevant drivers for 
revolutionary adaption (Chesbrough 2007). The innovation of a business model goes hand in 
hand with the change or the development of business model elements as well as the firm as 
a whole (Schallmo, 2013). Business model innovation aims to change value-creation in a 
firm, an industry-sector or even enables access to new fields of business (Stähler 2002). 
Schallmo (2013) identifies three different roles of technology in the innovation of business 
models: 
1) Technology as support for business models (e.g. to enable customer contact or 
improve processes) 
2) Technology as enabler for business models (e.g. the creation of a value otherwise 
impossible) 
3) The business model as instrument to market technologies (e.g. the marketing of 
technologies available to a firm using a business model) 
 
Therefore, the relationship can be seen as bidirectional. Business models can contribute 
towards the distribution of technology (Chesbrough et al. 2002) and therefore potentially 
provide solutions for sustainability matters. Further, new technologies show major influence 
on the generation of business models (Schallmo 2014). 
Eckert et al. (2000) characterizes sustainable technologies through making better use of 
natural resources and thereby contributing to a cleaner world. Major categories for 
sustainable technologies are resource preservation, renewable energy utilisation and 
pollution prevention (Elms & Wilkinson 1995). Heinz (2009) identifies the following 
characteristics to describe sustainable technologies: 
1) Technologies that enable significant savings of materials and energy 
2) Technologies that enable shifts from non-renewable to renewable resources, from 
non-bio-degradable to bio-degradable substances and from ecosystem consuming 
extractive systems to renewing and restorative ones 
3) Technologies that preventing emissions, contaminations and overall negative 
environmental impacts 
 
Subsequently, it is assumed that sustainable technologies show promise to contribute 
towards sustainable business models. However, sustainability is not an end in itself and 
inherently sustainable technologies do not exist (Mulder et al. 2011). Therefore, sustainable 
technologies need to be applied in appropriate business models in order to be able to 
contribute towards sustainability. In that regard firms need business models that transform 
the specific characteristics of sustainable technologies into new ways to create economic 
value and to overcome barriers standing in the way of their market penetration (Bohnsack et 
al. 2014). Unfortunately, the understanding of the relations between sustainable 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
301 
technologies and business models is only at its beginning. In order to contribute to the 
research towards more sustainable business models following research question is 
addressed: 
What is the influence of sustainable technologies on elements of business models? 
To do so, this paper uses a two-step approach: First literature and empirical data are 
used to establish a generic model on how technologies influence business models. Second, 
the established model is used to discuss the influence of a potentially sustainable technology 
on business models. Therefore, this paper uses publicly accessible documents as source to 
discuss the influence of fuel cell technology on business models in the automotive industry.  
Generic Model of the influence of technologies on business models 
The following section describes the process of establishing a generic model of the influences 
from technologies on business models. To do so, this section outlines the method of the 
generation of underlying empirical data. Following, relevant aspects concerning the 
investigated relation are presented.  
This model bases on 16 explorative interviews conducted with firms situated in the 
region of Austria and Germany in the time of December 2015 till April 2016. The criterion for 
the selection of the companies was a technology focus in their entrepreneurial activity. The 
size of the firms ranged from start-ups with less than 100 employees to multinational 
companies with more than 100.000 employees. In order to establish a generally valid data 
basis no specific differentiation between the firm’s branches was laid on. To further ensure 
the general validity of the results, decision-makers with a strategic as well as a technical 
background were interviewed. The interviews were conducted as semi-standardized guided 
interviews. All interviews were recorded and transcribed. The gathered data were 
subsequently investigated using a qualitative category-guided text-analysis approach as 
described by Mayring et al. (2014). Thereby relevant text-passages were extracted covering 
the field of analysis: 
1) Statements regarding the adaption of business models 
2) Statements regarding the requirements of business models towards technology  
The established units of analysis were subsequently used to inductively establish 
categories. This process required several iterations performed on parts of the data before 
the finalized categories were applied to the complete data set. Further, as described by 
Mayring et al. (2014) the objectivity of the procedure was ensured by a second coder. 
Differing interpretations were discussed and adjusted. Therefore, intercoder-reliability as 
well as intracoder-reliability is ensured. The rigor of the procedure is seen as sufficient.

Influences of technologies on business models 
Figure 1 lays out the basic relation regarding the influences between technologies and 
business models. Influencing factors are grouped, allocated to their internal or external 
origins and discussed in this section. The investigated relationship is highly complex, 
dynamic and influenced by a multitude of factors. Therefore, this paper only focusses on the 
influence of technology on business models. However, influences in both directions exist.

Figure 1: Model of influencing factors on the relation between technologies and 
business models 
The possibility to generate value is unanimously stated to have the highest priority for 
firms regarding the influence of technologies onto business models. Ongoing technological 
development forces firms to review their existing business model and ensure its viability. A 
major aspect thereby is the investigation of the usefulness of new technological possibilities. 
Simultaneously also the viability of the currently deployed technologies has to be 
questioned. If needed, business leaders have the task to establish new business models 
enabled by technologies (compare Chesbrough 2010). It is possible, however, that even 
pronounced changes in a firm’s technology have only little influence on a firm’s business 
model (compare Teece 2010). Further, business leaders are faced with the decision if 
technologies are best utilized in existing or new areas of business and their respective 
business models. 
A critical aspect is the generation of income with a current business model while 
adjusting to technological developments (e.g. substitutional technologies). The practical 
impact of this adjustment depends on a firm’s technology strategy (e.g. technology leader, 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
303 
late follower) and its capability for organizational change. Additionally, the relationship 
between technologies and business models is influenced by factors, that can be attributed to 
origins inside as well as the outside of a firm (compare Teece 2010).  
External factors 
External factors that have been stated to affect the relation between technologies and the 
business models are the firm’s macro-environment (compare Worthington & Britton 2009), 
the firm’s market as well as the respective customers on this market and the firm’s micro-
environment.  
Changes in the political, economic, socio-cultural, technological, environmental or legal 
surroundings can show effects on how technologies influence business models. However, 
depending on what scope firms operate, the influence of said factors may vary through 
regional differences (e.g. through different legislative regimes). Further, aspects like the 
typical length of innovation-cycles in a sector (compare e.g. firms in the electronics, 
automotive and energy sector), cultural tendencies (e.g. progressive, traditional) or its basic 
orientation (e.g. infrastructure-oriented, profit-oriented) can play a major role for the 
inquired relationship.  
A firm’s network (e.g. its suppliers, customers or competitors) is seen as a major 
influencing factor for the relationship under investigation. The specific influence of the 
elements in a firm’s network thereby depends on the respective level of collaboration 
(compare Schulte-Gehrmann et al. 2011). Further, depending on factors like a firm’s position 
in the value chain, its core competences, investment-costs for certain technologies or the 
sector a firm operates in, technologies can be pulled by the market or pushed by the firm. 
Additionally, further down the value chain the impact of technologies on firm’s business 
models is seen as less severe. However, it has to be noted, that firms not necessarily need to 
be limited to just one sector or position in a value chain. In addition, external causes, like a 
shift of competences in a firm’s network and the connected potential change in a focal firm’s 
performance range can be seen as a relevant factor influencing the relationship between 
technologies and business models (compare Casadesus-Masanell & Ricart 2009). 
Internal factors 
Internal factors influencing the investigated relationship that were identified are a firm’s 
resource base, its structure and organization as well as its culture. 
Resources are seen as enabler for technological and structural adjustments. Access to 
technology can be realized via internal R&D or acquisition. Further it can be stated, that the 
level of technological innovation not necessarily correlates with the respective amount of 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
304 
invested resources. Subsequently additional factors, like a firm’s strategy need to be taken 
into consideration as a moderating factor when investigating the influence of technology 
onto a firm’s business model. 
Results indicate that resources needed to establish changes in a firm’s technology are 
not limited to technology access. For instance, technological changes may require adaptions 
in a firm’s organization subsequently leading to follow up costs. Resources, especially in the 
form of physical assets can also be a hindrance for technological change. This, however, is 
also dependent on external influences, like for example the sector a firm is operating in (e.g. 
firms providing immaterial products typically require less physical assets than firms 
producing high volumes of physical goods). 
Further, a firm’s culture can be seen as moderator for the influence of technologies on 
business models. 
Discussion on the example of fuel cells in automotive industry 
One technology that shows potential for sustainability is the fuel cell. Using fuel cells, more 
sustainable fuels can be converted at high efficiencies. Therefore, fuel cells represent a 
viable alternative to current energy-conversion technologies (Singhal 2000, Milewski et al. 
2013). Although at the moment fuel cells relegate to a niche in the market, they show a high 
market-potential and high growth-rates (U.S. Department of Energy 2015).  
Based on the model outlined above, the influence of the potentially sustainable 
technology of the fuel cell on business models in the automotive industry is discussed. Since 
the discussion is based solely on publicly accessible documents, only external factors were 
taken into consideration. Table 1 summarizes identified examples. 
According to Hart et al. (2016) the fuel cell industry is fragile and highly driven by 
governmental support (e.g. through the Paris climate agreement). Past and current policies, 
however, already positively affected the industry (e.g. in form of a solidified supply chain). 
Further, industry has responded well to policies as well as signals from the market. Hart et 
al. (2016) find that companies are working towards solutions not only relying on policies but 
are driven by economic advantage, customer needs or corporate ambitions.

Limited supplier production capabilities (network partners) 
Enabling access to technological solutions (Toyota) 
Fuel cells infrastructure requirements (Linde, Toyota) 
 
Partners in a firm’s network (e.g. suppliers) providing fuel cell technology often have 
technical expertise unavailable to OEMs. Therefore, they are able to suggest modifications 
to components of the technology potentially improving performance or lowering costs. 
Additionally, strategic considerations (e.g. the desire to capture a potentially higher value 
part of the supply chain), considerations of risks or the availability of technological solutions 
(e.g. fuel cell components) are influencing factors. In case of the fuel cell technology this can 
lead to a higher level of collaboration along the supply chain or even the integration of 
suppliers. Further, suppliers affect OEMs in their ability to scale up production. From a 
technological point of view intermediate “freezes” in technology may be necessary, to 
ensure that investments in production capacities can be paid back before a following design 
iteration makes investments obsolete (Hart et al. 2016).  
Practical examples show that companies already operating in the automotive industry 
tend to use the technology of the fuel cell in adaptations of their usual business models. 
Hyundai offers their fuel cell cars only for lease (Hyundai, 2017). Toyota introduced its latest 
fuel cell car, the Mirai, initially only to certain markets (i.e. California) via conventional sale 
as well as lease agreements. The selection of target markets is assumed to be influenced by 
infrastructure and legal policies (compare CEPA 2016). Toyota subsequently expanded the 
sales-area, however kept production numbers low compared to other models in its portfolio. 
In addition, the technology was made publicly available (in form of a notable number of 
royalty-free hydrogen and fuel cell patents). Toyota accompanies this behaviour with 
marketing activities, explaining the benefits of fuel cell technology to customers. (DoE 2016). 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
306 
It can be noticed, that a large part of these business models aim to establish the 
technology of the fuel cell on the market. A likely reason for this is the underdeveloped 
status of the infrastructure required to operate fuel cell cars (Hart et al. 2016). Therefore, 
establishing cars using fuel cell technology on the market requires different approaches as 
well as the participation of different key partners than in existing business models. 
For example, the company Linde bought 50 fuel cell cars to use them in their car sharing 
program BeeZero in the area of Munich (Linde 2017). Goal thereby was to demonstrate the 
ability of fuel cell cars to drive longer distances compared to conventional battery electric 
vehicles (Hart et al. 2016). In this case the operator of the car fleet also represents a key 
partner for automotive firms in providing the required refueling infrastructure. 
To give another example on how the fuel cell technology influences business models in 
the automotive sector, the UK start-up “Riversimple” can be named. Riversimple aims to sell 
sustainable mobility for an all-in price covering maintenance, fuel as well as insurance using 
a fuel cell powered car of their own design (Riversimple 2017, Hart et al. 2016).  
However, also adaption of the technology to certain regional requirements can be 
identified. Nissan, for instance, introduced a fuel cell vehicle at the Olympic summer games 
in brazil, that utilizes bio-ethanol, a fuel sourced from sugarcane and corn readily available in 
the region (Nissan 2016, Pleskot 2016, RFA 2015). 
Furthermore, fuel cell operated vehicles are seen as highly suited for operation in 
environmentally sensitive urban areas (Hart et al. 2016). This shows potential to add value 
for customers in certain areas or even, depending on local policies, may be a unique selling 
point. 
Conclusion and Outlook 
The established empirical and theoretical generic model of the relation between 
technologies and business models is seen as suitable to investigate the influences of 
technologies on business models. From the discussed example it can be concluded, that the 
technology of the fuel cell has the potential to highly influence the creation of value (e.g. 
different key partners) as well as the value capture aspects of business models in the 
automotive sector (e.g. mobility as a service). Main drivers for the technology are given 
through legal policies (e.g. laws regarding car emissions, areal restrictions) as well as firm’s 
aspects to generate income through fuel cell technology. Therefore, fuel cell technology is 
gaining momentum leading to an increased application of the technology. Drawbacks for the 
application of the technology are given by a partial lack of technical expertise in the value 
chain and a lack in infrastructure. However, companies already committing to the 
technology are likely to face a shift in their business environments. New key partners (e.g. 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
307 
providing infrastructure or enable access to technology) already are emerging subsequently 
leading to a change of firm’s key activities in the automotive industry (e.g. providing 
alternative infrastructure, use of different propulsion technologies). Depending on internal 
company factors (e.g. revenue streams from existing business models, resource base, 
strategic focus) gradual changes like using already established approaches as leasing fuel cell 
cars up to radical new business models, like the one “Riversimple” introduced, are brought 
into application. Stated practical examples show, that through the application of the 
potentially sustainable technology of the fuel cell more sustainable business models in the 
automotive sector are being established. 
Limitations 
The introduced model only shows very generic relations describing the influence from 
business models on technologies. Looking at the example of the fuel cell it becomes clear 
that detailed investigations of firms, along firm’s value chains or even in a firm’s the value 
network are needed to improve the understanding of the influence of the technology of fuel 
cells onto business models in the automotive sector. Further, also the restriction to publicly 
accessible documents as base for discussion of influences in the automotive industry 
represents a limitation.

Abstract  
This paper focuses on social enterprises which work to address sustainability related aspects 
and to create social value through business. Those enterprises use elements from both for-
profit and non-profit logics which induces unique challenges to their development and 
survival. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to explore how the components of the business 
model of a social enterprise have changed since its establishment. This qualitative study 
applies a single case study approach. The case enterprise is from the Swedish electricity 
industry. The data collection includes 16 interviews and 2 focus groups. This study 
contributes to the field of BMI in the context of social enterprises by looking at how the 
different business model components have changed in different phases from the 
establishment of the firm until present day. The practical contribution of this study is to 
support the founders and managers of such enterprises during the business model 
innovation process by providing insights of how the business model could be changed in 
order to improve competitiveness.  
Introduction 
More than one billion people in the world live on less than 1.25 dollar each day (World Bank, 
2014) and approximately one fifth of the world’s population lacks access to water (United 
Nations, 2014). Each minute equivalent to 36 football fields of forest is lost throughout the 
world and the global warming is threatening to heat up our planet, followed by extreme 
weather changes and drastic livelihood changes of billions of people (WWF, 2014).  
These issues have planted the seed of awareness in the world, causing a rapid increase 
of active non-profit organizations over the last decade. For-profit organizations are also 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
312 
striving to create social and environmental value while non-profit organizations are adopting 
more and more commercial and business oriented logics in order to survive increased 
competition (Lumpkin, Moss, Gras, & Kato, 2013; Doherty, Haugh & Lyon, 2014).  
This means that the two traditional business forms of for-profits and non-profits are 
slowly drifting towards each other. While this is happens the social enterprises (SEs) take a 
more direct approach, in order to address that sustainability related aspects, since they sits 
in the middle between for-profits and non-profits with the goal to create social value 
through business (Battilana, Lee, Walker, & Dorsey, 2012).  
The SE concept has gained increased attention during the last decade among 
practitioners as well as researchers (Doherty et al., 2014; Wilson & Post, 2011). SEs use 
elements from both for-profit and non-profit logics, which creates tensions between the two 
within these enterprises (Battilana & Lee, 2014) and this induces unique challenges to their 
development and survive. Available research on how SEs succeed in managing their dual 
mission to avoid mission drift is limited (Ebrahim, Battilana, & Mair, 2014). Thus, this study 
focuses on the exploration of how the business model components of a SE have changed 
since its establishment. More specifically we study how the business model of a SE in the 
Swedish electricity industry has developed from its establishment until present day. 
Theoretical background 
Researchers and practitioners today frequently refer to the business model (BM) and to 
business model innovation (BMI) (Chesbrough, 2010; Lambert and Davidson, 2013; Spieth et 
al., 2014). Traditionally, the BM concept, which is multifaceted at the systems level, takes a 
comprehensive approach in its description of how companies strive to be profitable. An 
increased understanding of BM management would equip SEs with better tools to plan for 
the future as well as increase their survival rate.  
Every BM consists of a number of interrelated building blocks that form different 
configurations that can be used to evaluate change choices (Teece, 2010). Such 
configurations are almost always limited to the BM elements that contribute to the 
economic performance of the organization (Breuer et al., 2016; Upward and Jones, 2016). 
When the components of the BM are changed, we talk about BMI (Klang, Wallnöfer, & 
Hacklin, 2014).  
BMI is a relatively new field of research and has gained increased traction during the 
past decade (Zott et al., 2011; Spieth, Schneckenberg, & Ricart, 2014; Osterwalder & 
Pigneur, 2010). One main reason for this is that BMI can help organizations to gain a 
competitive advantage by dealing with the entire business system, and not only products or 
processes (Teece, 2010; Waldner et al., 2015; Spieth et al., 2014). Teece (2010) argues that 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
313 
organizations should actively seek and consider improvements to their BMs at all times, 
which means that BMI should be a continuous process in order to adapt to the continuously 
changing environment.  
According to Amit and Zott (2015; Zott and Amit, 2010), a BM describes the system of 
interdependent activities used by a firm and its partners. These activities include the 
mechanisms that link these activities to each other for the creation and delivery of value to 
customers while still allowing the firm to capture some of the value. The literature on SEs 
has a similar description of BMs (Lee, 2015; Yunus et al., 2010).  
Building on the research that conceptualizes BMs as configurations, Bocken et al. (2014) 
list three main elements in their definition of a BM: value proposition, value creation and 
delivery, and value capture. Value proposition mainly involves the customer offerings that 
generate financial profit. Value creation and delivery focus on creating value by entering 
new business areas and markets and by generating additional revenue. Value capture deals 
with the return from selling products, services, or processes to customers. According to Lee 
(2015), the changes in one BM component can directly or indirectly lead to changes in other 
BM components. Academics and practitioners have adopted this conceptualization of the 
BM (Klang et al., 2014). 
Methodology 
This study relies on Van de Ven’s (2013) definition of the narrative process for investigations 
of how BMI evolves in an organization. According to Van de Ven, process is “a narrative 
describing how things develop and change” (p. 148). As a continuous process of change, the 
BM change should be explored over a period of time that preferably includes multiple BMs 
so that triggers for changes and actual changes can be identified. In this study we view the 
change of the BM process as a sequence of events that lead to change in the components of 
the BM over time.  
The research employs a case study approach where the qualitative data has been 
collected via 16 interviews and 2 focus groups.  
The case company, AlphaEl (fictive name), is a Swedish electricity retailer that provides 
100% renewable and environmentally certified electricity to its customers. A non-profit 
foundation owns AlphaEl, and a County Administrative Board supervises its operations. 
Because AlphaEl is a not-for-profit SE, it donates its profits to non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs). AlphaEl’s philosophy is that its customers contribute to a better world 
each day through the consumption of the electricity it sells. Operating costs, including the 
salaries of its approximately 50 employees, are held at comparatively low levels. In 2015, 
AlphaEl had approximately 100,000 customers. Over the years, AlphaEl has donated almost 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
314 
41 million Swedish crowns to NGOs. Its long-term goals are to have 500,000 customers and 
to make annual donations to charity of 100 million Swedish crowns.  
AlphaEl was chosen for the case study because of its more than ten-year record of 
success in the Swedish electricity market, its selection as Sweden’s most sustainable 
electricity company for six consecutive years, and its commitment to the sustainability of the 
environment and society. 
Results and conclusion 
AlphaEl’s history related to sustainable BMI is presented in four time periods: Creation 
(2001-2004), Growth (2005-2008), Challenge (2009-2010), and Treading Water (2011-March 
of 2015). During each time period the company innovated the whole BM by changing 
different components of the value proposition, value creation, value devilry and value 
capturing. The last time period, Treading Water, the BM of the company is visualized in 
Figure 1.  
The focus of this period was to increase profitability through optimization of the internal 
processes and to be as cost-efficient as possible. Before this period AlphaEl had been making 
many ad hoc solutions, which are not always the most cost-efficient. The main changes in 
the company BM are in customer segments, value proposition, customer relationships and 
key activities. One significant change is the increased focus on customer retention and 
customer segments. It is important to be able to follow the customer life cycle, and to see 
the value of each customer. This is also connected to the increased work on optimization, 
trying to make each customer as profitable as possible. This BM also reveals an increased 
focus on digital platforms. This is shown by improved presence in social media, a rebuilt 
webpage and a striving towards digital payment methods.

This study contributes to the field of BMI in the context of SEs by looking at how the 
different BM components have changed in different phases from the establishment of the 
firm until present day. The practical contribution of this study is to support the founders and 
managers of SEs during the BMI process. This study gives managers of SEs deeper 
understanding of how the BM could be changed in order to improve competitiveness.

A case study in the bio-based economy

Introduction and purpose 
When sustainability has to be implemented in business practice and management, new 
opportunities can stem from business model (BM) innovation. The literature has recently 
highlighted the synergies created by this two fields of research (Boons & Lüdeke-Freund 
2013), where real innovation is usually radical and thus could not be limited to new products 
or processes introduction, but rather extended to a novel, comprehensive value creation 
and capture perspective (Bocken et al. 2013). 
Sustainable innovation usually requires a systemic, network-centered approach; in fact, 
when different partners in the network are considered, a collaborative business modelling 
emerges (Rohrbeck et al. 2013), where the building-blocks of business model should be 
redefined to a network-level BM (Lindgren et al. 2010). In networks, sustainable innovation 
is not limited to the idea of sharing the “value” (in terms of expected outcomes), but also 
the “values”, in a normative management perspective (Breuer & Lüdeke-Freund 2014; 
Breuer & Lüdeke-Freund 2017).  
This process is a dire challenge and scant is still know on how the BM is defined and 
employed in this context. Filling the gap, this study aims to explore peculiar aspects in the 
design and  implementation of network business models based on sustainable innovation. 
Methodology 
The paper presents a case study of business network, the CR 2050 Network, a partnership 
among nine farming and 11 manufacturing firms aimed at doing research to develop a new 
supply chain model in the field of bio-based economy. The data were collected through 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
319 
semi-structured interviews to the key-informants of the network (e.g., executives and 
managers of the participating firms), and document analysis on available sources from their 
press, the web, and other documents and reports (Creswell, 2007). 
Findings 
The CR 2050 network agreement was drafted at the end of 2013 by the use of a specific 
Italian regulation (L. 33/2009) the “contratto di rete” (business network contract), a private 
agreement where two or more firms agree to a defined common program, to exchange 
information or services, to collaborate for specific issues, or jointly manage common 
activities.  
The main purpose of CR 2050 is the coordination of the research efforts of firms already 
using raw materials from biomasses (or going to use them), with farms willing to conduct 
experimentations, in order to match supply with demand, create new supply chains, 
increase employment in the territory, use local raw materials and open new perspectives for 
both manufacturing and farming businesses. The vertical integration in CR 2050 is 
guaranteed by the presence of farmers, firms specialized in the transformation of agriculture 
products, chemicals and oleo-chemicals companies, biofuels producers and biogas plants.  
As emerged from the interviews, the transition to bio-based economy is a great 
challenge and the design of a shared BM is quite complex. The interviewees  described 
several critical aspects: biomasses are located on all earth surface and their intensive use 
cannot disregard the respect towards the ecosystems; it implies logistic and environmental 
problems coming from the handling of enormous amount of raw materials, the disposal of 
large quantities of wastewaters, and the removal of fertilizers from the soil; the EU 
regulation has been also described as a critical factor because it promoted the energy use of 
agricultural waste (biofuels and biogas) rather than starting from green chemistry, in order 
to create value within the whole supply chain. 
Conclusions 
The case highlights how radical sustainable innovation is affordable within a network 
perspective; the Italian regulation on business network contracts is an example of 
institutional change offering the opportunity to develop collaborative approaches 
(organizational innovation) to implement technologically-new business model archetypes 
like in the CR 2050 case the move from non-renewable to renewable energy sources (Bocken 
et al. 2014). 
The network can overcome the barriers to an effective sustainable business model 
innovation (Laukkanen & Patala 2014), like the need to meet new legislative requirements 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
320 
and the distortions created by related economic incentives (e.g. destined to energy industry 
rather than to the whole bio-based supply chain), but also the lack of awareness and 
understanding, by creating a vertical cluster dedicated to research, where each actor can 
share knowledge with other actors in the upstream and downstream supply chain. From a 
value mapping perspective, the CR 2050 network avoids value missing and create new value 
opportunities also for the weak partners in the supply chain (the farmers usually depending 
on state contribution). Shared values and principles on which the network is based are: the 
cascade use (hierarchy of use: first food, than feed, chemicals, biofuel and burning/disposal); 
the idea that the chemicals and the energy from renewable sources have to adapt to the 
territory, not the opposite; the optimization of logistics in the use of waste products from 
agriculture and the reduction of environmental impacts; the equal dignity to agriculture and 
manufacturing and the “everybody or nobody” principle of action. The interviewees assert 
that these values are implicitly recognized by the engagement in the network, even if the 
main driver referred was the need or the opportunity to convert the business in response to 
regulation and other environmental challenges.

Abstract  
Nowadays digitalization is on everyone’s mind and affecting all areas of life. The rapid 
development of information technology and the increasing pervasiveness of digitalization 
represent new challenges to the business world. The emergence of the so-called fourth 
industrial revolution and the Internet of Things (IoT) confronts existing firms with changes in 
numerous aspects of doing business. Not only information and communication technologies 
are changing production processes through increasing automation. Digitalization can affect 
products and services itself. This could lead to major changes in a company’s value chain and 
as a consequence affects the company’s business model. In the age of digitalization, it is no 
longer sufficient to change single aspects of a firm’s business strategy, the business model 
itself needs to be the subject of innovation. This paper presents how digitalization affects 
business models of well-established companies in Austria. The results are demonstrated by 
means of two best practice case studies. The case studies were identified within an empirical 
research study funded by the Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology 
(BMVIT). The selected best practice cases presents how digitalization affects a firm’s 
business model and demonstrates the transformation of the value creation process by 
simultaneously contributing to sustainable development. 
Introduction 
The fast-paced development of information technology and the increasing pervasiveness of 
digitalization represent new challenges to the business world (Turber et al., 2014). 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
324 
Digitalization and the so-called fourth industrial revolution have not only an impact on an 
organization’s range of products and services, but also to the value creation processes. 
Access to information for suppliers or customers is available 24/7 and people are used to get 
in touch with companies and their services or products regardless of time and place. These 
new requirements but also new possibilities and chances push companies to rearrange their 
strategy and furthermore adapt or renew the business model.  
On that account the Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology 
commissioned a study conducted by three Austrian Research and Consulting companies, 
Salzburg Research Forschungsgesellschaft mbH, Evolaris and Syngroup, in order to evaluate 
the current status of digitalization and Industry 4.0 within Austrian companies and the effect 
of digitalization on a company's business model. Thereby 68 mainly Austrian companies 
were interviewed. The main findings of the study presented within this paper, summarizing 
which types of new business models are being considered or already implemented due to 
digitalization. In addition, the paper focus on two selected best practice case studies. The 
changes in the respective business model are described in detail and illustrated by means of 
a business model canvas (Osterwalder & Pigneur, 2010).   
Furthermore implications of new business models on sustainability and sustainable 
development are considered. Some authors (e.g. Seele & Lock, 2017) argue that 
digitalization might be one driver for sustainability. But so far it remains unclear whether 
and how digitalization “facilitates or impedes the development of a more sustainable world” 
(Seele & Lock, 2017, p. 184). Hence, a closer look on how new business models contribute to 
sustainable development will be covered within the paper.  
Theoretical Background  
Even though the digital transformation just started and is considered to be at an early stage, 
it has already significantly affected organizations in all areas. Not only B2C relationships are 
changing in terms of connected devices and digital networks but also B2B relationships 
already have and will further change in the near future. Especially traditional value chains 
are developing towards new ways of value creation and multiple value creation networks. 
Fundamental changes in organizations ecosystems are forcing a company to change its 
strategy and its business model (Paulus-Rohmer et al, 2016). Furthermore the level of 
complexity is increasing based on (upcoming) large-scale digital networks, occasionally in 
conjunction with disappearing industry boundaries and the aforementioned changes from 
linear value chains towards complex, dynamic value creation networks (Lassnig et al., 
2017).

Business model innovation and digitalization 
Even though, the business model concept is discussed for several years within scientific 
community and practitioners, there is still a lack of a commonly accepted definition (e.g. 
Baden-Fuller & Morgan, 2010; Shafer et al., 2005). Generally speaking, the term “Business 
Model” refers to a description or model that represents a firm’s logic to create, provide and 
capture value from and for its stakeholders (Bouwman, 2008). Within this paper we referring 
to the often used and tested Business Model Canvas (BMC) by Osterwalder & Pigneur (2010) 
for visualizing the business model of the two case studies presented in this paper (see 
chapter 4.2). By Business Model Innovation (BMI) we refer to the ways organizations 
establish or change their business logic from the moment that an idea is created, analyzed, 
tested and in the end adapted to form their business model (Heikkilä, 2010) in parallel with 
technological, social, product or service innovation. Advances in digital technologies have led 
to the emergence of new business models that potentially challenge the status quo of many 
industries. In particular IoT and big data technologies play a central role for adaption and/ or 
entirely new developed business models. 
Business models for sustainability  
Additionally to conventional business models, there is a rather new topic within the scientific 
community, dealing with business models for sustainability (BMfS). Similar to the business 
model concept, there is not yet a commonly accepted definition about what a BMfS is and 
how it looks like (i.a. Baden-Fuller and Morgan, 2010; Wells, 2013). The difference to 
conventional business models is that BMfS focus on the three different aspects of 
sustainability, the social, environmental, and the economic dimension instead of focusing 
solely on financial profit. Furthermore, BMfS focus on stakeholder consideration (Wells, 
2013) and on multiple value creation. Additionally, ethical sourcing and an efficient use of 
resources are essential within a BMfS, as well as cooperative collaborations and network 
building (Jonker, 2012). In general, sustainable development can be supported by 
digitalization in not only the environmental but also the social and economic sphere (Hebling 
et al. 2012). Due to the increasing use of digitalization within companies more transparency 
and accountability is possible which leads to new possibilities of shaping, monitoring, 
communicating and governing sustainability within a company (Seele & Lock, 2017; 
Heemsbergen, 2016).  
Methodology  
Firstly, an in-depth literature research was carried out by covering German and English 
scientific literature and actual studies in the field of “Industrie 4.0”, “Industrial Internet”, 
“Internet of Things”, “new business models” and “digital transformation”. More than 90 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
326 
relevant studies, reports, books and papers were identified and 14 selected articles were 
summarized in a study report in order to provide a solid literature basis.  
Secondly, 68 interviews with middle and top managers of mostly Austrian industry 
companies were conducted. The interviews were based on a semi-structured interview 
guideline covering questions about experiences within the field of digitization e.g. actual and 
future projects, drivers and barriers and effects on the current business model. The average 
duration of the interview was approximately one hour. The interviews were recorded, 
transcribed and evaluated by means of a qualitative content analysis. 
The case studies were implemented by applying the case study methodology from Yin 
(2014), following the steps of planning, doing, preparing, collecting, analyzing, and sharing. 
Based upon the company interviews, further research within already existing literature, the 
webpages of the companies and additional open interviews were conducted. All information 
were collected and revalidated by the companies. For this paper two out of the five best 
practice cases studies are presented.  
Results and discussion  
The aims of the conducted study were to identify business model patterns that are already 
implemented or to be considered within Austrian companies and which challenges 
companies are facing by innovating their business model. The main focus on the presented 
paper is to provide insights into how digitalization affects a company's business model and 
simultaneously contributing to sustainable development by providing insights out of two 
best practice case. 
General results of the study  
Based on a theoretical framework combined with the findings from the 68 company 
interviews, seven business models patterns could be identified that are considered within 
Austrian companies. Companies consider the digital transformation to be more evolutionary 
than revolutionary. The analysis justifies the classification of the detected business model 
patterns into evolutionary business model patterns (the underlying business model remains 
the same → minor changes) and into revolutionary patterns (radical changes related to the 
entire business model).  
Evolutionary business model patterns can be summarized as:  
1) Smart automation,  
2) Digital Add-Ons,  
3) Connected products and data-driven Services, and 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
327 
4) Object Self Service. 
 
Revolutionary business model patterns include:  
5) Everything as a service,  
6) Pay per X, and  
7) Digital Lock-In.  
 
ad 1) Smart automation refers to changes within the product process that tends to be 
smarter, better connected and more efficient. Especially the trend towards mass 
customization benefits from new technologies and the possibility to produce small lot sizes 
up to production with lot size one.  
ad 2) Due to the increasing connectivity and the industrial internet of things it is possible 
for a company to offer additional digital services to their physical products, which is called 
digital add-ons. Variations of this business models are also known as freemium model or 
physical freemium. In this case physical products are sold and digital basic services are 
offered for free. Free services are offered in order to attract many customers, whereas only 
a limited amount of customer want to use further “premium” services that need to be paid.  
ad3) The business model pattern “connected products and data-driven Services” refers 
to products that are equipped with sensors collect data about themselves, their use, the 
user and their environment. These condition data may help to reduce default risks and 
provide a solid basis for decisions about the planning and improvements of the production 
and maintenance process.  
ad4) Object self-services provide a possibility in order to reduce costs and implement a 
more efficient value chain. Resources, intermediates, or spare parts can be ordered not only 
online, but also automatically due to new technologies. 
On the contrary to evolutionary business models, revolutionary business model patterns 
cause radical business model changes e.g. new value proposition, new revenue model, new 
customer segments.  
ad 5) The first example for this category is “Everything as a service” (XaaS). With a XaaS 
the value proposition of a business model is changed completely. Products, software, and 
hardware might be offered as service in order to fulfill customer needs and create additional 
value.  

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
328 
ad 6) Due to new technologies, sensors, information and data, it is possible to offer 
products and service to the customers that are only paid when in use. Mostly companies 
offer full service packages where maintenance is included as well. 
ad 7) The final business model pattern identified is “digital lock-in”. In this case 
customers are “locked-in” the environmental system of a company. Lock-in is generated 
either by technological mechanisms or considerable interdependencies of products or 
services.  
Case studies  
The aim of the case studies is to demonstrate how digitalization impacts well-established 
business models by indicating changes in the business models and trying to point out 
relations to aforementioned business model patterns. Furthermore we indicate possible 
sustainability aspects of the respective business model.  
Atomic Austria GmbH  
The Atomic Austria GmbH is an Austrian based company in the sector of winter sports 
equipment. It was founded in 1955 and has between 650 and 800 employees. Atomic is 
operating mainly within the B2B sector within the European, US, Canadian and East Asian 
market and belongs to the Finnish Amer Group. Atomic is world market leader in the field of 
alpine ski production.  
The business environment of Atomic is constantly changing and Atomic is facing several 
challenges. The market for alpine skiing is regarded as stagnant, to some extent also 
declining. One of the main challenges for Atomic is on the one side the decreasing amount of 
ski sales due to the trend towards a sharing economy, facing on the other side an increasing 
customer request for a wide range of products. Therefore, the topic of optimizing the lot size 
is getting into the focus of attention. After each lot the production machines need to be 
refitted manually. The degree of automation within the ski production process is, especially 
compared to other manufacturing companies, quite low. 
In general, Atomic is dealing currently with two major projects concerning digitalization 
and Industry 4.0. One is dealing with topics like control technology, data collection, and 
traceability. The other project is dealing with smart automation, in order to make the 
production process smarter and more efficient.  
The production process of a single ski consists of up to eight different steps. This process 
need to be designed as efficient as possible, in order to avoid downtimes and reduce 
response times in case of incidents. Furthermore, all relevant data and information need to 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
329 
be gathered, in order to optimize the production. The collected data help to retrace the 
single steps of the production. Therefore, Atomic is cooperating with the Austrian company 
COPA-DATA and is using the software HMI SCADA. Additionally, set-up times are reduced by 
one third. In consequence a smart test system was implemented. This makes it possible to 
measure the quality of the products in real-time for reducing additional sanding processes 
by simultaneously ensuring a high quality standard.  
Furthermore, the material stock of Atomic is reduced based on new interface with their 
ERP system.  
Furthermore, collected data about energy use, air humidity, temperature, and 
compressed air are linked together via a platform and provide information for an 
autonomous production system, in order to avoid rejects and low quality projects.  
But digitalization does not only affect Atomic productions, it also affects their value 
proposition towards their customer, their customer relationship and their distribution 
channel. Atomic is the first company within its sector that is offering an online shop, where it 
is possible for customer to design their individual skis. This implies a totally new way of 
customer relationship, as this is Atomic’s first direct connection to their end customer. 
The following figure shows which elements of the business model changed due to 
digitalization.  
 
Figure 1: Changes in the Atomic Business Model

The business model of Atomic changed significantly within the age of digitalization. The 
company's supply chain changes by integrating suppliers in the production process and by 
connecting data, in order to make the supply chain smarter and more efficient. The 
production process itself, as described above, is getting more efficient and smarter and so 
do the products. Skis are equipped with a QR Code in order to connect it with information 
and data useful on the one hand for the customer and on the other hand for Atomic. 
Furthermore, the distribution channel changed significantly as totally new ways of sale in 
terms of an online shop are used. Customer relationship is also changing by means of the 
first direct contact to the end consumer instead of the distributer. Key partners are changing 
due to new collaborations, also beyond the industry sector. Due to the new offers like 
individualized, self-designed skis the value proposition is changing. As a consequence of new 
distribution channels and a changed production, also the cost structure is changing.  
In relation to the above defined business model patterns, Atomic’s new business model 
fits to the business model pattern smart automation, as well as to digital add-on’s. Within 
the near future also the business model pattern 3) connected products and data driven 
services might be relevant. 
Sustainability aspects 
As the business model is changing significantly due to digitalization and smart production so 
does the environmental and social performance of the company.  
Atomic is a company that cares for regional, social and environmental aspects already 
since a long time. These efforts can be seen as for example in 2009 the first boot for skiing 
was developed which consisted up to 80% out of materials from renewable resources 
(Süddeutsche Zeitung, 2009). Furthermore, Atomic uses wood chips instead of oil for the 
whole production (Standard, 2016).  
Nevertheless, due to the digitalization and the changes within the business model 
further potential for the contribution towards sustainable development emerged. Due to 
new machines and a smarter and more efficient production process not only the level of 
energy consumption is reduced. Less waste is produced and due to quality test with real 
time information, fewer products are rejected. Thanks to the use of new technologies and 
machines the cooling water of machines is used for heating, the heating system is optimized 
due to variable circuits and efficient circulation pumps. Due to automated block systems, it is 
possible to optimize the system for compressed air. All together this leads to reduction of 12 
tons CO2 per year and electricity saving of 233.000 kWh. Which leads to a cost reduction of 
about 223.000 € for the company.

Furthermore, Atomic is firmly established in the regional economy and it creates lots of 
jobs in the region. The company is the third largest employer in the region (Pongau/Sbg). 
Therefore, the headquarter and the Austrian production sight are highly valuable for the 
regional value creation.  
Zumtobel Group 
The Zumtobel Group, an international lighting group and a leader in the field of innovative 
lighting components, works together with Bosch Software Innovations to develop energy-
efficient and intelligent commercial buildings. In the pilot project "Life Cycle Tower ONE" 
(Rhomberg Group) in Dornbirn, an innovative lighting management system was installed, 
which takes advantage of IoT with networked light solutions. 
The overall system provides real-time insights into the areas of energy consumption, 
energy saving per luminaire, per floor and for the entire building, as well as visualization of 
the presence data (persons in the room) and the area use. In terms of maintenance, the 
system provides notifications of faulty lights, provides insights into the operating hours and 
the usage history of the lighting system. On the basis of this data a new business model for 
the service called NOW! was established. The new service offering NOW! provides customer 
lighting as a service and guarantees an optimized lighting level, efficient lighting solutions 
and long-term functionality. The innovative sales approach relies on professional project 
management and flexible service contracts, which allow customers to submit the issue of 
lighting to the Zumtobel Group as an experienced partner. This also means that customers 
do not necessarily have to buy the new lighting, but can purchase light as a pure service. 
This also results in a number of financial advantages for the customer: the investment 
capacity is not burdened, possibilities are shown and thus the immediate saving of operating 
costs is realized. The monthly fixum for the lighting service is clearly defined in advance and 
can partly refinanced by the saved electricity and maintenance costs thanks to modern IoT 
and LED technologies. This innovative business model is also implemented through tailor-
made financing options, from leasing or hire-purchase to managed service contracts. In 
order to be able to meet the needs of the customer in the best possible way, the contracts 
are composed of various service modules. In addition to guaranteed lighting levels and 
energy efficiency, modules for improving the comfort of the user can also be selected. For 
example changing the color temperature, automatic daylight and presence control and 
individual lighting control. 
 

 
NBM@Graz2017

Figure 2: Changes in the Zumtobel Business Model 
In summary, almost the entire business model is changing through the establishment of 
NOW !. As illustrated in figure 2, the orange marked business model segments have changed 
significantly through the implementation of the new service offer. The biggest changes are in 
the areas of value proposition (tailor-made full service package of product & service for the 
entire duration of the contract) and revenue model (conversion from purchase model to 
monthly installments over a certain period). However, changes also result in customer 
relationships, sales channels, key activities and key partners. In addition to the new business 
model of Zumtobel NOW! it is also possible to provide new data-based services for the 
customers from the sensor data of the light system (e.g., presence sensors). To which 
extend these new services are offered to the customer and whether or how these services 
are monetized has not yet been established. With regard to the business model patterns 
elaborated in chapter 4.1 the Zumtobel business model matches to pattern 5) Everything as 
a Service (lightning as a service) as well as to pattern 3) Connected products and data driven 
services provided out of all kind of sensor data.  
Sustainability aspects 
Buildings account for almost half of global energy consumption. As a result, future lighting 
infrastructure will play a key role in enabling energy and cost savings. It is projected that 
most of the building-based IoT equipment installations will be carried out by 2020 on the 
basis of lighting infrastructure. The advantages of a light-based Internet of things go far 
beyond the benefits of light management. For example, the data from the presence sensors 
also provide information on how defined areas (e.g. office rooms or entire floors) are used 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
333 
or utilized at all. If there are some spaces detected where hardly anyone is present, these 
areas can be re-purposed - for example, in meeting rooms or in flexible offices, where 
several users share a desk. This optimizes space management. At the same cost, you can 
increase productivity, make offices easier to work with, or save on premises and reduce 
rental and operating costs. Simultaneously, this information can also be used to better 
evaluate energy saving measures, optimize room management and consequently increase 
sustainability.  
Conclusion and Implications  
In general it can be summarized that the topic business model innovation due to new 
(digital) technologies has arrived and gained importance for Austrian companies.  However, 
there is a major difference in the implementation pace and the degree of innovation of the 
business models. The evolutionary development of business models is preferred by most of 
the surveyed companies, since the basic nature of the service offer remains. In contrast, 
there are also companies that are already making radical changes that affect the entire 
business logic (see cases in chapter 4.2). To achieve this, new interactive and agile 
development processes must be introduced, which ensure a rapid customer feedback. In this 
dynamic environment of uncertain planning requirements and permanent new orientations, 
a good vision and a digital strategy are recommended. 
As changes in the business model often have functional, interdepartmental, but also 
across-company impact, cooperation over existing borders is essential. In most companies, 
this is rather difficult due to existing structures, which often leads to conflicts. Proactive 
communication at all organizational levels is thus a key success factor for digital 
transformation projects. In principle, it can be said that the awareness and ideas for new 
digital business models are available, but the companies will have to be even bolder in their 
implementation. A stronger action orientation is required.

Abstract 
In the age of digital technology cars will have to exceed their former functionality as a tool 
for transportation to survive as status symbols. One feasible approach is to provide valuable 
digital services based on car sensor data which currently is used for the sake of driving only. 
Hence the ‘quantified self phenomenon’ can be transferred to modern cars - becoming 
‘quantified cars’. The paper provides insights into the quantified car phenomenon and 
explores the approaches of car manufacturers and tech start-ups on their journey to develop 
novel digital services and sustainable business models. At the moment, cars are an ideal 
playground for innovative US tech start-ups backed with risk capital to establish new 
ecosystems following the examples of Google and Facebook. In contrast to that, especially 
German-speaking car manufacturers have been rather reluctant to reap the value of ‘their’ 
car operation data in delivering successful digital services to stakeholders. However, two 
recent reports from ‘Verband der Automobilindustrie’ (VDA) – the German automotive 
industry association – suggest that Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) have to hold a 
stronger position in the future and may limit the capabilities of third parties to freely access 
car data. If implemented as described in the VDA reports, then the battle for a car data-
service-ecosystem will progress to the next round.

Introduction 
Capturing real world events and digitizing them into machine-readable information has 
become increasingly important. The digital age has transformed humans to data generators, 
while they consciously or unconsciously have left behind their ‘electronic traces’ (Wolf 
2013).  ‘Quantified self’ is a term coined to describe the intended collection of any 
measurably characteristics about a person, including biological, physical, behavioral, or 
environmental aspects (Swan 2009). Usually data is collected through the consumer devices 
of ‘Quantified Selfers’, most notably through smartphones.  
Quantified self has become a major creator of value through Android/iOS mobile 
applications. One example is the Austrian start-up Runtastic which provide a smartphone 
application (105 million registered users) to analyze how users perform when they run, bike, 
etc. Runtastic was acquired by Adidas in 2015 for about 220 million EUR. Adidas now holds 
the power to the knowledge of designing sportswear combined with the digital knowledge 
on usage gained through the user base of Runtastic, which can offer new insights for 
individual product development. This acquisition demonstrates that big industrial players 
invest into innovative quantified self start-ups with an exploitable mass of collected data 
from a broad user base. So what can this acquisition of a quantified-self start-up contribute 
to the car domain? During the last two decades, passenger cars have slowly turned into 
computers on wheels (Haeberle 2015) equipped with many sensors used for functionality, 
safety and joy. Taken into account that cars capture sensory data about themselves and 
about their environment, the behavioral patterns of self-tracking can be transferred to cars 
(and vehicles in general), which in this sense become ‘Quantified Vehicles’ (Stocker et al., 
2017).  
Obviously, quantifying cars in terms of analyzing driving data and developing innovative 
applications is a comparably new phenomenon. The continuous collection of car operation 
data can enable the analysis of both car- and driver behavior and thereby facilitate the 
generation of innovative digital products, services as well as sustainable business models for 
many beneficiaries, including e.g. drivers and organizational customers. There are many 
opportunities to reduce emissions by stimulating safer driving and improving road safety 
while caring more about the natural environment by using novel digital services as the 
following Table 1 suggests.

Car manufacturers may use digital services to optimize 
powertrain calibration for special usage behavior (e.g. in postal 
delivery transport).  
Automotive engineers may improve the accuracy of driver 
models and testing for advanced driver assistance systems. 
 
There are many stakeholders who have an interest in exploiting the data generated by 
cars either supporting their current business processes and models or adapting them 
towards establishing digital ecosystems. However, in the scope of this paper, two 
stakeholder groups are of particular interest: Car manufacturers as the owners of the 
underlying technology and ICT start-up companies especially from the tech savvy USA, who 
are keen to develop new digital ecosystems in the automotive domain. Against this 
background, the paper outlines the following research question:  
What are the roles of start-ups vs. car manufacturers in delivering novel 
digital services and sustainable business models built on car operation data 
analysis?  
After this introduction in section one the paper will introduce background, motivation 
and the research approach in section two. Based on that, the paper will present approaches 
towards novel digital services and elaborate on the positions of ICT start-ups versus car 
manufacturers, exploring suggestions of the VDA in section 3. The paper will conclude with a 
discussion on future opportunities of these two stakeholders in section 4.

Background and research approach 
Background and motivation 
Digitalization is a sociotechnical process on encoding analog information into a digital format 
(digitizing) applied to social and institutional contexts, transforming their sociotechnical 
structures, thus rendering digital technologies infrastructural (Tilson et al., 2010). 
Digitalization results in digital artifacts characterized by editability, interactivity, 
reprogrammability/openness, distributedness (Kallinikos et al., 2013), also implying a shift in 
product design moving from modularity to generativity (Yoo et al., 2012). Quantified cars are 
one of the key results of digitalization in the automotive industry, where incumbents have to 
face competing concerns systematically interrelated, as shown by Svahn et al. (2017) 
through the case of Volvo Cars: innovation capability, innovation focus, innovation 
collaboration, and innovation governance. Thus, from a strategy perspective, digitalization 
enforces internetworking considered as “those business processes/activities conducted or 
mediated online between employees, customers, suppliers and partners of firms, using 
internet-based technologies accessed through internet-based infrastructures.” (Brews & 
Tucci, 2007, p.224). Besides incumbents digitalization enables digital entrepreneurship 
providing less bounded entrepreneurial processes and outcomes and less predefinition in 
entrepreneurial agency (Nambisan, 2016), as shown also, e.g., by the rising number of start-
ups focusing on quantified cars. Accordingly, the role of information value is a central 
challenge in the competitive scenarios emerging from digitalization as well as information 
capacity of companies (Viscusi & Batini, 2014). Key questions here are: What data do I have? 
How is their quality? Can I exploit them in their full potential? What can I infer from them? 
While ICT start-ups have already started to apply the quantified self phenomenon to cars, 
launching apps and services to generate a new market, car manufacturers are currently in 
the transition process from vehicle manufacturers towards integrated mobility and data 
service providers. According to Dedrick (2010) researchers have framed the impacts of IT on 
environment as first-order (impacts from IT hardware during the product lifecycle), second-
order (impacts of ICTs on other processes such as transportation or industrial production), 
and third-order effects (changes in lifestyles and economic structures). The latter are 
relevant when considering the increased use of social media transformative potential of 
‘green’ information systems on the demand side, encouraging practices such as, e.g., 
carpooling and ridesharing applications coupled with the Internet of things (Malhotra et al., 
2013). According to Malhotra et al. (2013) this two- way, sensor-driven communication is 
blurring the boundaries between the production side and the demand side. Furthermore, 
information systems and interdisciplinary strategies for quantified cars may provide models 
to assess the value of information, in particular the social value of related open data (Viscusi 
et al., 2014).  

 
NBM@Graz2017

Taking the above issues into account, business models are a key element for competing 
in markets characterized by extensive use of ICTs and currently transformed by 
digitalization. In general terms, a business model describes the rationale of how an 
organization creates, delivers, and captures value (Osterwalder & Pigneur, 2010). Massa et 
al. (2017) provides a systematic view on the different perspectives on business model 
research pointing out that business models can be considered as i) attributes of real firms, ii) 
cognitive/linguistic schema, and iii) formal conceptual representations/descriptions of the 
former two issues. As for conceptual representations, Al-Debei & Avison (2010) identified 
four key dimensions of business model: value proposition, value architecture, value network, 
value finance. As for business models as attributes of real firms it is worth mentioning the 
definition by Zott & Amit (2010), who conceptualize a business model as “a system of 
interdependent activities that transcends the focal firm and spans its boundaries. The 
activity system enables the firm, in concert with its partners, to create value and also to 
appropriate a share of that value” (2010, p. 216). This definition is useful for understanding 
business models of companies interested in quantified cars when linked to the above 
concept of internetworking and current pervasiveness and strategic relevance of digital 
platforms (Parker et al., 2016). Considering quantified cars, despite the “analyzing” stance of 
the main market players, a set of traditional and new business models can be applied 
(Shipilov, 2016), in particular the infomediary one (Afuah & Tucci, 2000) can be adopted 
under a utility perspective and extended from data collection for, e.g., marketing purpose to 
data useful for social value, as capability and functioning they enable (Viscusi & Batini, 2016), 
and finally for sustainability issues.  
Besides environmental and societal issues, business sustainability refers to “business 
models and managerial decisions that creates value over the short, medium, and long terms, 
based on mutually beneficial interactions  between the company’s value chain and the social 
and environmental systems on which it depends” (Lüdeke-Freund et al., 2016, p. 18). 
Furthermore, Schaltegger et al. (2016, p. 6) points out that a business model for 
sustainability “helps describing, analyzing, managing, and communicating (i) a company’s 
sustainable value proposition to its customers and all other stakeholders, (ii) how it creates 
and delivers this value, (iii) and how it captures economic value while maintaining or 
regenerating natural, social, and economic capital beyond its organizational boundaries.” 
Still, business model innovation in automotive industry asks for understanding the different 
ways the various actors can follow to innovate their business models; in particular, as 
pointed out by Massa & Tucci (2014, p. 424), business model design in newly formed 
organizations, which refers to their “entrepreneurial activity of creating, implementing and 
validating a business model”, and business model reconfiguration in incumbent firms, 
encompassing the reconfiguration and eventual acquisition of organizational resources to 
change an existing business model.

Research approach 
This paper is aimed to provide a first exploration of the position of innovative ICT start-ups 
vs. car manufactures towards establishing new services and sustainable business models. 
Although the topic quantified car per se is in the domain of car manufacturers, an increasing 
number of ICT start-ups have used their innovation capabilities to develop own means for 
capturing this valuable data source.  
Against this background the authors of this paper conducted a desk research approach 
analyzing information available on the Web to further explore the activities of quantified car 
start-ups and car manufacturers. They have used a combination of the terms quantified, 
connected, vehicle, car, and start-up in search engines to capture the current developments. 
Furthermore they have used crunchbase.com to capture additional meta-information on 
company location, business and funding. 
After having identified the major quantified car start-ups, which are listed in Table 2, 
two authors have studied start-up websites in detail to find out more about their visions and 
goals as well as about their business models, products and services. Both authors have 
reviewed the websites of all start-ups and discussed their knowledge with the other person 
afterwards to come to a common understanding. The information was then validated by two 
additional persons, which are co-authors of this paper as well. 
Results: An exploration of novel services and business models  
The position of ICT start-ups in the USA towards exploiting car data 
In analogy to the quantified self movement, the dominating IT/Web industry of the USA has 
already lined up a series of quantified car start-up companies backed by risk capital, reaching 
more than 20 million USD in some cases, demonstrating how high investors perceive the 
market value of a car data ecosystem for quantified cars (Stocker et al., 2017). The start-ups 
exploit data generated by cars while driving. The crucial source for any data-driven start-up 
is data and this statement also holds for quantified car start-ups. The following table lists 
start-ups which have been identified in desk research. It provides an overview and includes 
the company names, their URL as well as their value propositions provided on the website.

For data acquisition purposes, start-ups must involve car drivers/owners somehow. The 
car driver creates data while driving his car and therefore has to be understood as the owner 
of the driving data. While car manufacturers have a comparatively easy technical access to 
the data a car generates during its operation, tech start-ups have to identify novel ways on 
how to capture this data before they can use it in applications. The conducted research has 
identified two major data acquisition approaches pursued by the start-ups: 
 The first approach, pursued by the majority of quantified car start-ups including e.g. 
Automatic or Mojio, is to utilize a branded hardware plug connected to the OBD-II 
interface, a standardized interface for all modern cars. This allows them accessing 
certain car sensor data, e.g. speed or rpm. They may equip their devices with 
additional sensors including GPS or accelerometer to collect additional relevant data 
describing the movement of the car. Both plug and internet connectivity are usually 
not free of charge. They produce a lock-in effect to the particular business model of a 
quantified car start-up and are one way to safeguard revenues. 
 The second approach, e.g. pursued by Zendrive, is to use the sensors built into 
modern smartphones, e.g. GPS, accelerometer or luminance, to capture data while 
driving. This makes smartphones suitable devices to track car trips, too. However, 
smartphones lack information provided by car sensors including emission data or 
rpm. Nevertheless smartphones have the advantage of an ‘always on’ connectivity 
for event extraction and service provision. 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
343 
The reviewed start-ups have specialized in capturing, storing, and analyzing large 
quantities of car data and offering services in smartphone applications to motivate for 
sharing valuable driving data. The majority of start-ups are capable of extracting interesting 
driving events including e.g. hard brake, hard acceleration or speeding to name a few.  These 
events are hidden in the field data and have to be revealed through applying data analytics. 
Mobile applications running on the user’s smartphone then pull the results and visualize 
them on the driver’s smartphone. Figure 1 provides snapshots of such mobile app user 
interfaces.  
 
Figure 1: Start-up Apps: Automatic, Mojio and dash (Stocker & Kaiser, 2016) 
Some start-ups even provide APIs and software development kits to software 
developers in order to increase their market reach through third party apps or even to 
become the most important car data service platform, through a business model 
comparable to Apple iTunes. Some may even pursue the strategy of being bought by a big 
player in the future. These start-ups are definitely eager to increase market penetration. 
Their main competencies are applying novel data analytics on large quantities of trip data, 
storing large quantities in their datacenters, providing innovative mobile applications to the 
user including gamification apps as well as dashboards and interfaces for other parties (e.g. 
fleet managers) to allow analytics on fleet data.

The position of car manufacturers towards the quantified car 
phenomenon 
Regarding access and ownership of car generated data, car manufacturers are in a 
comparably lucky position. However, they were not very successful in exploiting this market 
yet. The potential to exploit car lifecycle data for purposes other than driving currently 
remains almost untapped by automotive OEMs (Stocker et al., 2017). According to the EU 
research project AutoMat (AutoMat, 2016), the automotive industry has not yet been able 
to successfully establish an ecosystem for apps and services equivalent to that of 
smartphone manufacturers. The project mentions three reasons why OEMs are currently 
struggling: Brand-specific business approaches dominate, and as a consequence there is a 
lack of brand-independent car lifecycle data. Current proprietary car services focus on the 
individual customer, what leads to privacy concerns, and few ideas exist how anonymized 
car data can be used to establish other services. The implied or required collaboration 
between OEMs on car data and services is considered risky in terms of competition.  
However, success and interest in car data start-ups seem to have made an impact on 
OEMs business strategies. As the AutoMat system structure (Figure 2) illustrates, OEMs are 
interested in taking over the data provider role and to establish a car data ecosystem: Data 
acquisition systems will be integrated into cars. Cat data is transmitted to an OEM backend, 
where it can be cleaned and enriched with further relevant information before publishing it 
to service providers, e.g. tech-start-ups, which then can provide third party applications on a 
marketplace. Though there is an OEM backend, the Automat System terms its approach an 
‘open ecosystem’ in its deliverables, where the willingness of other stakeholders to pay for 
digital business models is an important topic, too. 
 
 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
345 
 
Figure 2: The AutoMat System (AutoMat, 2016) 
 
Tech start-ups heavily depend on the OBD-II interface yet. If access to this interface 
would be limited or denied, their business models would be endangered. A recent eeNews 
Automotive (2017) article titled ‘German car industry plans to close OBD interface’ 
emphasizes the hypothesis that car manufacturers want to take over the data provider role, 
it states:  
Instead, the data will be made accessible to interested third parties through 
a neutral server, and basically under control of the automotive industry. 
There are two relevant recent position papers from VDA concerning the role of the 
German-speaking car manufacturers towards digital car data ecosystems. The position paper 
‘data protection principles for connected vehicles’ (VDA, 2014) refers to the continuous 
transformation of vehicles towards ‘connected vehicles’ with a permanent uplink to the 
internet and the feasibility to connect various data sources for establishing new services. The 
position paper suggests three principles for VDA members to handle the advancements in 
connectivity and the new services associated with respect to responsible data handling as 
well as with data protection: 
 Transparency: VDA members strive for adequate information about the data in 
connected vehicles and the use of these data. 
 Self-determination: VDA members are striving to enable customers to determine 
themselves the processing and use of personal data through various options. 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
346 
 Data-security: VDA members strive to implement the strong safety culture in 
connected vehicles. 
The short paper closes with a chart of data categories in connected vehicles and their 
relevance for protection: 
 
Figure 3: Data categories in connected vehicles (Source: VDA, 2014) 
The second position paper titled ‘access to the vehicle and vehicle generated data’ 
(VDA, 2016) discusses data-centric requirements for security, privacy, and discrimination 
free innovation. According to this report, each OEM has the role of a system administrator 
and is hence responsible for the safe and secure transfer of car data to a business to 
business (B2B) OEM interface. Third parties can access this car data directly over the OEM 
B2B interface or via neutral servers, which gather the data from the cars. 
 
 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
347 
 
Figure 4: Access to vehicle generated data (Source: VDA, 2016) 
According the information contained in the position paper, direct access to this data for 
third parties will be disabled. As a result, access to car data may be very limited in the future 
for start-ups, because OEMs want to increase their influence on what stakeholders can do 
what with the data cars generate. 
Conclusion and Outlook 
Modern cars have become data generators. Hence, their data can be collected, stored in 
databases, analyzed, and finally aggregated to generate new products, digital services, and 
business models. In analogy to the quantified self phenomenon which is about capturing the 
data about oneself to provide new insights to people’s behavior, the authors have coined 
the trend described above with the term quantified vehicles (Stocker et al., 2017).  
The authors expect that many stakeholders have an interest in exploiting car data to 
provide digital services. There are certainly a lot of benefits to achieve if this is done 
accordingly, which will increase individual driving safety as well as road safety. Furthermore 
many of these activities will have a direct influence on the environment as safer driving 
through less speeding, fewer braking, and smoother accelerating will positively correlate 
with reducing emissions while driving.   
Two concrete stakeholder groups were focused, US ICT start-ups and German car 
manufacturers. While ICT start-ups adopt either an OBD-II interface plug or smartphone 
sensory to capture data, car manufacturers would have a direct access to car data - at least 
from a technical perspective. US ICT start-ups have occupied the market in a new freshness 
by creating new services and business models based upon analyzing large quantities of car 
data. They have built up an enormous expertise in gathering and exploring field data, 
detecting patterns and events in the data or providing analyses which are of interest to

drivers. However, recent articles and reports from VDA suggest that German car 
manufacturers have become aware of the huge market which is at loose to the ICT industry. 
Hence, OEMs start to advance own projects and discuss restricting the OBD-II interface. Car 
manufacturers are seeking new opportunities and may establish a data market for third 
party services. If German car manufacturers will pursue the approach described in both VDA 
reports, then the battle on setting up a successful car data-service-ecosystem will progress 
to a very exciting next round.

Abstract 
New business opportunities in the digital economy are established when datasets describing 
a problem, data services solving the said problem, the required expertise and infrastructure 
come together. For most real-word problems finding the right data sources, services 
consulting expertise, and infrastructure is difficult, especially since the market players 
change often. The Data Market Austria (DMA) offers a platform to bring datasets, data 
services, consulting, and infrastructure offers to a common marketplace. The recommender 
systems included in DMA analyses all offerings, to derive suggestions for collaboration 
between them, like which dataset could be best processed by which data service. The 
suggestions should help the costumers on DMA to identify new collaborations reaching 
beyond traditional industry boundaries to get in touch with new clients or suppliers in the 
digital domain. Human brokers will work together with the recommender system to set up 
data value chains matching different offers to create a data value chain solving the problems 
in various domains. In its final expansion stage, DMA is intended to be a central hub for all 
actors participating in the Austrian data economy, regardless of their industrial and research 
domain to overcome traditional domain boundaries. 
Introduction 
The modern economy with its digitally supported processes lays the foundation for new, 
data-driven businesses opportunities. Enterprises in various different industries are 
recognising the potentials hidden in their own data or in data spread across their partners. 
But data alone is not enough to leverage the potential hidden within, hence additional data, 
data services and the right infrastructure are required assets to solve problems or derive 
new business opportunities (Immonen et al., 2014, Desai et al. 2007):

 Problem: At the beginning stands an unsolved problem or a need for improvement of 
a process. The problem needs to be clearly defined and the requirements of the 
solution outlined. 
 Data: Data is the means to represent the problem and the underlying process 
explicitly or implicitly. In many cases the data might be provided by the problem 
owner, at least partially. If the problem owner has none, not enough, or not the right 
data, further data sources are required and the different datasets need to be merged 
accordingly. 
 Service: One or more pieces of software and algorithms are commonly needed to 
work on data to create a workflow from raw data to reliable and interpretable 
information. These are called data services or just services for short. Typically, the 
workflow starts with data cleaning and pre-processing, flowed by merging the 
datasets, then the main analytics and processing steps take place before the results 
are textually or visually reported. All of those steps require the appropriate, 
compatible and interconnected services. 
 Infrastructure: A computing infrastructure is required to store the data and provide 
the computing power for all the necessary data services. This could be provided by 
the problem-, data-, or service owner or by an independent party offering an 
Infrastructure as a Service (SaaS) product. 
 Consulting: For any aspect mentioned above, consulting might be required as the 
respective owner might not have the needed expertise in all possible scenarios. This 
is usually the case if a new combination of data, services, and infrastructure is set up 
by the involved partners. 
 Matchmaking: Matchmaking can be seen as a special kind of consulting, namely the 
support in finding the right partners supplying data, services, and consulting to solve 
the problem at hand. 
Each of these aspects corresponds to a role or an actor responsible for it. The Data 
Market Austria (DMA) (Research Studios Austria, 2016) is a nationally funded lighthouse 
project to create a digital ecosystem i.e. a multi-sided market where the matchmaking 
between the roles takes place. In its final expansion stage, DMA is intended to be a central 
hub for all actors participating in the Austrian data economy, regardless of their industry 
sector. Hence, DMA is the important link to bring Problem Owners (PO), Data Providers (DP), 
Service Providers (SP), Infrastructure Providers (IP) and Consulting Providers (CP) together. 
In DMA, POs get a central address point to find the required partners and DPs, SPs, IPs, and 
CPs get a common distribution platform to offer their products. The difference between the 
interactions of all the participants in the DMA compared to the current situations is 
illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

Currently, 
Problem 
Owners (PO) have to constantly 
coordinate the Data Providers (DP), 
Service 
Providers 
(SP), 
Infrastructure Providers (IP), and 
Consulting Providers (CP) in order 
to create their solution. 
Figure 2: With DMA, POs are given a 
single address point to find the 
required DPs, SPs, and IPs. Similarly, 
the DPs, SPs, IPs, and CPs have a 
common platform to presents their 
products and interact. 
Very important for the success and the benefits of DMA are the various brokers. A 
broker is the central instance to establish the connections between the PO, DP, SP, IP, and 
CP (Immonen et al., 2014). Each broker has to know the offers available on DMA to find the 
right solutions to satisfy the needs of the POs. Such an extensive knowledge about the 
potentially very volatile content cannot be kept by a human, but requires extensive support 
via a DMA software service. This software service in question will be the recommender 
service, or recommender for short. It keeps track of all the offers on DMA and can suggest 
potential collaborations between the different actors to a human broker or to the actors in 
DMA directly. 
Related Work 
Bold claims along the lines of “Data will be the new oil” summarise the potentials and hopes 
associated with data today. The similarity is even used further, namely data in its raw from 
is, like crude oil, next to useless (Rotella, 2012). In other words, the potentials hidden in raw 
data can only be used when data is processed by the right services, and even more when 
different kind of datasets are linked together to find new coherences between different 
domains. The process from raw data to new knowledge solving problems is often referred to 
as data value chain (Cavanillas et al., 2016). Data ecosystems offer a common platform to 
share and trade all building blocks for data value chains (Immonen et al., 2014). Many of 
these ecosystems are founded along the paradigm of Open Innovation, meaning that 
companies offer previously confidential data to an open community since they expect better 
results from the bigger, open community active on a data ecosystem compared to the 
smaller and closed community within their enterprise. The openness can manifest itself in 
different degrees, reaching from collaboration with only trusted partners based on a clear 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
354 
billing model right up to completely open collaboration with any parties free of charge 
(Dahlander et al., 2010). Leading the way in Open Innovation are governments, NGOs, and 
other public entities, while commercially oriented organisations are dragging behind. 
Nonetheless, multinational enterprises like Nike, Master Card, Twitter, and IBM (Buda et al., 
2016) are also contributing to data ecosystems. Buda et al. (2016) contribute this to four 
major motivational factors: 
 Generating new revenue streams: This is the most common motivator for 
commercial organisations to take part in in data ecosystem. The idea can be to sell 
the data directly or generate a revenue by analysing the data and improving or 
extending the current business with information from within the data. In the latter 
cases, the participation at a data ecosystem might be motivated by a lack of 
knowledge or resources insight the company. 
 Community building: When partners, customers, and other entities are jointly 
working on a problem, a new community is established. Hence, the company can 
interact with the community to find new employees or customers. 
 Internal business improvement: Providing data or services as part of a data 
ecosystem requires knowledge about how to prepare and publish the offers in a data 
ecosystem. This knowledge can also be useful when a data-oriented collaboration 
with business partners is required. Participation in a data ecosystem can be a good 
training ground for such data-oriented collaboration with partners. 
 Publicity and PR: The participation on a data ecosystem can be used to generate 
public attention and to shape the public opinion about an enterprise.  
The success of any digital ecosystem, and of DMA in particular, depends on lively 
interaction in the digital ecosystem. Hence, the broker is most important in establishing the 
matchmaking between the individual parties starting the desired interactions (Immonen et 
al., 2014; Desai et al., 2007). The “broker” concept is usually associated with an intermediate 
person involved in commercial negotiations or transactions. Specifically, a broker might be 
an agent who buys stocks, land, or any other kind of goods or assets and sells them for 
others (Bissinger, 2015). From a high-level perspective, the same principle can be applied 
when facilitating the mapping between offerings and demands of data and services in the 
DMA. The state of the art analysis implicates that there are only a few research works that 
built upon the basis of recommender systems and data/service brokerage. The work 
presented in (Laleh et al., 2015) is among the few addressing not only the issue of service 
brokerage between providers and consumers but also the issue of data brokerage. This work 
proposes a context-aware cloud service brokerage framework as a mechanism enabling the 
inter-mediation between SaaS clients and providers, and supports the process of data 
integration among SaaS providers. This initial concept has been picked up and is transformed 
into the DMA environment were the two concepts are brought together.  

 
NBM@Graz2017

The core concept behind the broker in DMA is a human strongly supported by a 
recommender system. In recent years recommender systems have become an integral part 
in many applications (such as Amazon, Netflix and MovieLens) supporting humans in finding 
interesting information in an overloaded information space. Although the first recommender 
systems were developed already in the mid-1990s, the interest in this research area still 
remains high due to its problem-rich characteristics. The main problem targeted by 
recommender systems can be formulated as suggesting a set of domain-specific items I (e.g., 
data set, services, infrastructure etc.) to users which are of interest for the users while the 
same time are also new to them. In order to determine this set of items, several 
recommender approaches have been developed. (Ricci et al., 2011) 
Since traditional recommender systems mostly focus on a single domain (e.g., books at a 
bookstore, hotels at the travel agents), they adapt and apply a recommendation approaches 
best suitable for the domain model at hand. Commonly, the recommendation approaches 
are selected depending on how easily (or hard) it can be adapted to the existing domain 
model (Traub et al., 2015). Since the prediction task is usually viewed as a two-dimensional 
problem, user-item interactions are the easiest to apply, and are therefore the most 
commonly utilised data feature (Lacic et al., 2015). However, if supporting a diverse set of 
domains becomes an important issue in modern recommender systems (Lacic, 2016). Since 
DMA is recommending basic tuples containing datasets and services (respectively dataset 
and service providers) the two can be seen as two domains with different intrinsic 
relationships. 
Proposed System 
The central architecture of the recommender system in DMA (illustrated in Figure 3) is 
focused around the matchmaking framework responsible for the data ingestion and 
information enrichment. The enriched information will further be used by the search and 
recommender engine based on ScaR (Scalable Recommender Framework). It has already 
been used in various domains from basic item recommendation to finding social institutions 
based on free text problem statements (Traub et al., 2016). 
a.  Data input and matchmaking 
The data input service is divided into separate modules, one for each data source. Hence, 
there are four modules one for dataset metadata, one for service metadata, one for user 
profiles, and the last one for interaction data. Each module encapsulates the API of the 
respective data source to minimise the required changes if an API gets modified or 
extended. Each source actively pushes new data or updates to the source connection 
modules minimising the latency between the occurrence of a data change and the effect of 
the data change on the recommendation and search service. The next step in the data input 
service is the information extraction (IE) which itself is divided into a pre-processing and a 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
356 
main stage. The pre-processing step is executed for each data source individually. It covers 
merely a unification of the vocabulary in the input data and generates a common data 
representation. In the main stage, the actual IE is carried out. The IE transforms the 
unstructured texts from the input metadata into structured information interpretable by the 
recommender. Furthermore, a cross-referencing and validation of the input data between all 
input sources is done. 
b.  Service evaluation 
The evaluation module assesses the suitability of services under two different aspects. First, 
the output generated by services will be evaluated in terms of task-specific efficiency and 
effectiveness. Second, for assessing a complete process (consisting of one or more datasets 
and services), specific and significant evaluation metrics are needed. The requirements for 
metrics will be examined, developed, and made available as services which are used by the 
recommender to identify the best service for the given problem. 
c.  Search 
The search enables users to execute queries against the metadata catalogue to find services 
and datasets. Further, the results can then be filtered by so called search facets. Facets are 
filters to narrow the search results and help the users to find the right results.

d.  Recommendation 
The recommender service is the core of all services. It automatically generates suggestions 
of possible datasets and service combinations on the DMA portal. In contrast to the search, 
it also incorporates user profiles and interactions made by users on the platform to generate 
the suggestions. The recommendations are automatically generated meaning that they are 
not triggered by the users explicitly but implicitly when they navigate to a page of the portal. 
Recommendations in DMA are primarily based on metadata and interactions (Damiani, 
2015) of users with services, datasets and other users creating a context and enabling the 
matchmaking based on this context. By using this metadata and profile of each user, 
personalised recommendations for collaboration between different parties on DMA are 
generated. DMA will extend this matchmaking functionality to incorporate insights about 
user interactions with the DMA Portal to also include implicit and explicit feedback 
(Jawaheer, 2015) by the users. Explicit feedback is given directly by the user like assigning a 
one to five start rating to an item), while implicit feedback comes non-intrusively from 
interactions such as clicks on item descriptions. We propose to alter the recommendation 
strategies to be adaptive and incorporate the feedback into the process, which leads to a 
system capable of learning and adapting to current needs and situations. 
e.  Backend 
The search and recommender services use Apache Solr (Smiley et al., 2015) as a data 
backend. Solr provides the capability for horizontal scaling, by creating either shards (i.e., 
splitting the data into smaller indices to increase the performance of search queries for huge 
data sets) or replicas (cloning the existing shards to another machine to increase the fault-
tolerance of the whole system). Furthermore, the built-in MoreLikeThis (Smiley et al., 2015) 
search method uses the vector space model represented by Term Frequency – Inverse 
Document Frequency (TF-IDF) values to find similar items. This functionality is particularly 
useful for developing recommender approaches which need to process large amounts of 
data and still provide high performance. All modules can be deployed and started in multiple 
different instances either on the same or on different machines, thus supporting horizontal 
scaling. To keep track of all deployed modules, we make use of Apache ZooKeeper (Haloi, 
2015). All registered services are coordinated by ZooKeeper and they can be divided into 
hierarchical namespaces to deploy several different recommender domains on one system. 
Vision and implications 
DMA was commissioned in 2016 by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) and the 
Austrian Ministry for Transport, Innovation and based on the recommendation by the results 
by Berger et al. (2014) to bring Austria on the forefront of the European digital economy. 
While DMA is outlined as a research project, it should develop a fully functional data 
ecosystem capable of leading the Austrian data economy. DMA is designed as the central 
hub for the data driven economy in Austria. I.e. all industry, academic, NGOs, or research 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
358 
parties can take part regardless of their main business domain. DMA follows the principle of 
offering a breeding ground to start data driven projects and applications. Hence, DMA is not 
targeted at any specific domain or application all the different players in the data economy 
are invited to use the DMA infrastructure to find new partners or to extend existing 
partnerships. This is a major differentiator to projects like the Industrial Data Space in 
Germany (Otto et al., 2016) or EUDAT (Lecarpentier et al., 2013) focused on specific 
domains. The DMA brokers supported by the recommendation services are committed to 
help DMA participant to find the partners the needs. Hence, DMA sees itself as an domain-
agnostic enabler for digital business in Austria. 
To show the potentials of the DMA platform and the possible collaboration in the 
Austrian data economies, two pilot systems implementing complete data value chains are 
already planned. The first pilot is a holistic taxi fleet coordination system solving the problem 
of taxis working on full capacity at one location, while there are empty taxis waiting 
unoccupied somewhere else. Based on the weather forecast, timetables of public transport 
network, the entertainments and event calendar, traffic information, and historical data, the 
ideal distribution of the taxi fleet is predicted. The second pilot focuses on the field of earth 
observation, where data from the European Space Agency (ESA) will be used to judge the 
heath of parts of the Austrian forests and to track the changes over time given new insights 
into the environmental developments in Austria. 
These two examples should highlight the potentials for DMA to become the central hub 
for the data driven economy in Austria with connections to the European community. 
Commercial and non-commercial organisations, governmental institutions, private parties, 
universities, research institutions, and any other legal entities are invited to participate on 
DMA offering their datasets, services, infrastructure, and expertise. Particular focus will be 
given to the start-up community, where special funding opportunities are created to 
kickstart the development of services tailored for datasets within DMA. Human brokers 
working with the offers on DMA are supported by the recommender service to create value 
chains and setting up collaborations between the involved parties on DMA. The brokers 
foster the collaborations and create a thriving ecosystem out of the individual offers 
presented on the DMA platform. 
Conclusion and future work 
In its final expansion stage, DMA is intended to be a central hub for all actors participating in 
the Austrian data economy, regardless of their industry sector. Comparable initiatives target 
limit themselves to only a single specific domain, for example the Industrial Data Space in 
Germany (Otto et al., 2016).

By the end of the project, we expect to have a sustainable Data-Services Ecosystem in 
Austria, initially running on Austrian cloud infrastructure provided by multiple project 
partners, using the innovative foundational technology and business models developed 
during the project. Through the pilots, the Austrian mobility and space communities will be 
well established in the ecosystem, with further communities beginning to use it. The start-up 
support during the project will lead to first demonstrations of commercial use of the 
ecosystem. 
The matchmaking and recommendation service will be a crucial element of the success 
of the platform. It will enable the DMA customers to find the right services and data using 
the best suitable infrastructure for their given problem. It helps to decrease the time and 
effort when bringing together all the necessary elements. 
In the current phase of the project, the technical work packages finalised the technology 
foundation and specification of the required central services. The next phase of the project 
will create the first prototype of the platform with all the central services in place. At the 
beginning of the second phase there will be an extensive screening, validation, and 
evaluation of the current implementation state. The results of this evaluation will determine 
the concluding steps in creating the final platform.

The Relational Factors Affecting the 
Transition to New Business Models

Abstract  
This conceptual study, aims at contributing to theoretical development of New Business 
Models (NBMs), by creating a better initial understanding of relational factors affecting the 
transition to NBMs in the age of digitalization. Considering that co-value creation with 
stakeholders is one of the main characteristics in NBMs, the studies on how the relationships 
with stakeholders are created, maintained and utilized are of great importance. 
Furthermore, the relationship intensive nature of B2B exchanges made them an interesting 
area of focus in this study.  
The study objective was achieved through incorporating the scholarly contributions in 
three interconnected relational concepts of legitimacy, social capital and trust in NBMs and 
digitalization studies. An interesting observation was the existence of an interplay between 
opposing economic and social values when implementing NBMs in light of digitalization. This 
was evident in all three relational concepts under the focus of this study and in line with a 
proposition previously made by other scholars. This interplay can be between information 
transparency and privacy, opportunism and trust or between efficiency and legitimacy. This 
study has also developed this proposition further by suggesting that apart from their 
complementary nature, it is possible for the opposing values in these three areas to 
reinforce each other as well. 
Introduction 
Manufacturing companies are gradually adopting a servitization strategy by moving towards 
offering a bundle of goods and their associated services rather than the goods alone (Visnjic 
et al. 2016). Digitalization had been argued to play a significant role in this process. As there 
is a widespread belief that digital technologies can act as both enablers and drivers of 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
363 
servitization (Holmström & Partanen 2014; Vendrell-Herrero et al. 2017). Therefore, one 
immediate consequence of these changes, is the need for implementing New Business 
Models (NBMs) that incorporate the elements of both digitalization and servitzation as part 
of the business offering logic of these product firms (Spieth et al. 2014; Takey & Carvalho 
2016). One of the main underlying assumptions in NBMs is the major departure from the 
previous narrowly defined concept of value creation (Porter & Kramer 2011). The value 
creation in these NBMs will be in a more shared and collaborative form with the 
stakeholders of the business (Takey & Carvalho 2016). Therefore, stakeholders and 
particularly customers are undeniably an important source of value creation in NBMs (Spieth 
et al. 2014; Ulaga & Eggert 2006). Thus, it is important to study how relationships with these 
stakeholders are created, maintained and utilized.  
Noteworthy to mention, is the distinction that should be made between business 
models of Business-to-Customer (B2C) and Business-to-Business (B2B) companies. As these 
two models, tend to differ from several aspects. The exchanges in B2C models, does not 
capture the social relationships which are established in B2B segments (Robey & Cousins 
2005). Such relationships are typically facilitated through embedded and interpersonal 
interactions between the involved parties (Schultze & Orlikowski 2004). Manufacturers in 
many business markets have a tendency towards forming closer relationships with certain 
key customers and suppliers (Ulaga & Eggert 2006). Moreover, the business exchanges of 
B2B companies are usually associated with higher demands on maintaining the privacy of 
business actors (Robey & Cousins 2005). In addition, customization is becoming central in 
value creation of B2B offered services and is characterized by knowledge and relationship 
intensity (Kindström 2010; Madhavaram & Hunt 2017). The above discussions signify B2B 
companies as an interesting area of focus, when studying the transition to NBMs. 
As discussed above, there is a clear shift in focus from transactions to relationships in 
NBMs (Barnett et al. 2013). Considering that the shared value creation in NBMs has proven 
to be a reciprocal practice (Simmons et al. 2013). This will result in restructuring of 
stakeholders’ interactions with organization under NBMs. This restructuring is even more 
pronounced in customer relationships of B2B companies, in light of prevalence of 
digitalization in NBMs. Since managing complementarity of digital technologies and 
customer-relationships can create tensions (Schultze & Orlikowski 2004). There had 
however, not been enough research addressing what it takes to manage such 
complementarity (Schultze & Orlikowski 2004). A few studies have shown that this process 
of integration between digitalization and relationships is more challenging when 
digitalization is substituting or cannibalizing traditional products (Vendrell-Herrero et al. 
2017), supports arm’s length and impersonal linkages or reduces the necessity for traditional 
embedded relationships with customers (Schultze & Orlikowski 2004). Having in mind that 
one of the key factors in generating value and repeat business had been the embedded 
relationships with customers in B2Bs (Schultze & Orlikowski 2004); provision of digitalization

can indeed “produce a paradigm shift in consumer valuation” (Vendrell-Herrero et al. 2017). 
This complexity can further increase in the case of NBMs where the actual relationship 
becomes a value parameter itself (Ulaga & Eggert 2006). 
The wave of digitalization in New Business Models of B2Bs, often leaves firms in a 
crossroad between the opposing economic and social values (Robey & Cousins 2005). That 
is, the choice between transparency and privacy in information access (Robey & Cousins 
2005), between opportunism and trust in relationship of actors (Nooteboom 1996; 
Williamson 1993) and finally, between the advantages of efficiency and legitimacy in 
business relationships (Grewal et al. 2001; Son & Benbasat 2007; Robey & Cousins 2005). 
Hence, these underlying relational issues in NBMs highlight the importance of three 
intertwined concepts of legitimacy, social capital and trust. The objective of this paper is 
therefore to bring together the scholarly discussions on these three relational concepts in 
regard with digitalization and NBMs. With the aim of providing a common and conceptual 
understanding, that can act as a starting point in addressing the relational issues in NBMs. 
Digitalization & Relational Factors 
This section discusses the three concepts of legitimation, social capital and trust in light of 
digitalization in NBMs. This is followed by the analytical discussion that takes place in the 
next section. 
Legitimation 
Achieving legitimacy is an objective, undertaken by companies when embarking on a new 
area of activity (Suchman 1995). The broadly accepted definition of legitimacy that was 
decided to be adopted in this paper, is the definition proposed by Suchman (1995); whose 
work in synthesizing the diverse literature in legitimacy is considered as one of the main 
reference points in legitimacy literature to this date: 
Legitimacy is a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an 
entity are desirable, proper or appropriate within some socially constructed 
system of norms, values, beliefs and definitions (p.574). 
The digitalization in NBMs can expose companies to concerns about gaining/regaining 
legitimacy in two different ways. First, it can be in the form of pragmatic legitimacy which 
arises from the “self-interested calculations of an organization’s most immediate audience” 
(Suchman 1995, p.578). In this case, an organization can be considered as legitimate if its 
practices and business model, conform to the expectations of its immediate stakeholders 
(Robey & Cousins 2005). However, the legitimacy of the firm can be questioned if its 
practices after the transition to NBMs, does not comply with self-interest of customers and 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
365 
other stakeholders. Second, is in the form of organizational isomorphism. That is, when 
organizations seek to achieve legitimacy through adopting processes, strategies and 
structures that had already been implemented in their industry (Deephouse 1996). 
Therefore, adopting to new technologies and NBMs, can be a legitimacy motive for firms 
who are active in industries where their suppliers and competitors already practice NBMs 
(Grewal et al. 2001; Son & Benbasat 2007). There are no consensus in literature on whether 
larger or smaller sized companies engage more heavily in legitimating behaviour. Since there 
are contradictory claims arguing for either one of them (Dowling & Pfeffer 1975; Stone & 
Brush 1996).  
Suchman (1995) divides legitimation strategies into three groups of gaining, maintaining 
and repairing legitimation. He claims that there are not enough scholarly contribution when 
it comes to strategies for maintaining and specially repairing legitimation. His argument 
stands true to a large extent even to this date. He summarizes the literature on strategies to 
gain pragmatic legitimacy into: 1) Conforming demands, by responding to needs, co-opting 
constituents and building reputation; 2) Market selection, by locating friendly audiences and 
recruiting friendly co-optees and 3) Advertising product and image (Suchman 1995). As for 
strategies to maintain pragmatic legitimation: 1) Monitoring tastes, through consulting 
opinion leaders and 2) Protecting exchanges, by building reliability, communicating honestly 
and stockpiling trust (Suchman 1995). There are also studies suggesting that different types 
of marketing activities such as market sensing are recommended tools to be used as 
legitimating devices, when B2Bs attempt to re-build their legitimacy after their transition to 
NBMs (Simmons et al. 2013). Moreover, Hart & Sharma (2004) propose that networking with 
fringe stakeholders (i.e. those beyond the core stakeholders) of the business, is another way 
for preserving operating legitimacy of the company. Alternatively, Woodward et al. (1996) 
suggest that through communication, organizations can attempt to amend the definition of 
social legitimacy, in order to conform it with their own current practices. 
As we have already briefly touched upon it in introduction, there are always two 
opposing values of efficiency and legitimacy when B2Bs decide to adopt digitalization. The 
legitimacy aspect have already been discussed above. Efficiency on the other hand, suggests 
that B2Bs who adopt digitalization, base their decision on the rationalistic expectation of 
improving their economic efficiency and transactional processes via digitalization (Son & 
Benbasat 2007). There are quite different and all equally interesting findings in this regard in 
the literature. Robey & Cousins (2005) argue that organizations do not need to be efficient 
to be successful. They can increase the probability of survival by adopting legitimating 
strategies that make them isomorphic with their environment. They further posit that the 
benefits of digitalized exchanges should outweigh its costs for costumers to adopt them 
(Robey & Cousins 2005). On the other hand, Grewal et al. (2001) claim that for a firm to 
achieve an expert state in digitalization, a proper mind-set should be developed that stresses 
on efficiency and de-emphasizes legitimacy motives. Almost in line with this argument, Son 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
366 
& Benbasat (2007) posit that if the decision to adopt digitalization only has legitimacy 
motives, it should be kept on hold until there are efficiency motives in the picture as well. 
They argue that this may otherwise waste the resources of the firm (Son & Benbasat 2007). 
Social Capital 
Woolcock (1998) defines social capital as the “information, trust and norms of reciprocity 
inhering in one’s social networks” (Woolcock 1998, p.153). It is believed by majority of 
scholars in this field, that social capital benefits in relationships are realized through three 
main means of: 1) Information flow, 2) Trust, 3) Norms  (Burt 2000; Coleman 1990; 
Granovetter 2005). For some scholars such as Uzzi (1996), having interpersonal and 
embedded relationships, is the answer to achieving all three means of social capital benefits 
(i.e. information flow, trust & norms). Scholars such as (Granovetter 1973) on the other 
hand, despite agreeing on positive role of embedded relations (or as Granovetter would call 
it, strong ties), in achieving trust and norm related benefits of social capital; argue that novel 
and heterogeneous information can only flow through arm’s length relations (or weak ties). 
As according to these group of scholars, embedded relations over time, tend to only flow 
homogenous and redundant information (Burt 2000; Granovetter 1973).  
As already mentioned in introduction, the nature of business exchanges in B2B settings 
are often in the form of embedded and interpersonal relationships (Schultze & Orlikowski 
2004), with fewer key suppliers and customers (Ulaga & Eggert 2006). There is also a 
tendency towards maintaining privacy of information being shared (Robey & Cousins 2005) 
and their offered customized services are mainly knowledge and relationship intensive 
(Kindström 2010; Madhavaram & Hunt 2017). The emergent of digitalization can have 
significant effects on B2Bs’ social capital related factors. In some instances, the 
implementation of new technologies, negatively influence conditions of embeddedness. 
Schultze & Orlikowski (2004) argue that arm-length relations facilitated through 
implementing Information Technology (IT) tend to undermine the trust generated in 
embedded relationships. Consequently, organization actors will begin expending the 
previously generated social capital with their customers, in an attempt to mend their 
relationships or to promote the newly introduced technology (Schultze & Orlikowski 2004). 
Digitalization can also lead to more transparency in the information being shared within B2B 
relationship networks (Robey & Cousins 2005). This may cause a reduction in the exchange 
of situated and privileged information and therefore, a decline in prospects of sustaining and 
creating social capital with stakeholders (Schultze & Orlikowski 2004).  
There is however, another side to every story. There are therefore also studies that 
illustrate either the benefits of social capital during transitions to NBMs and digitalization, or 
how digitalization can further improve the social capital creation in B2Bs. For instance, 
Wagner et al. (2014) propose that alignment of IT and organizational goals, can be mediated 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
367 
through non-strategic and operational social capital. Moreover, Schultze & Orlikowski (2004) 
posit that using new technologies can also be effective in strengthening embedded relations, 
as a complementary support for interpersonal relationships.  Furthermore, several studies 
have pointed out the important role that intermediaries play in digitalization process of 
B2Bs. Intermediaries are the connection point between organization and the external 
networks they are linked to, such as their customers (Coleman 1990). Almost all major 
scholars in this field had touched upon the important role that these actors play in social 
capital creation. However, they labeled them with different terms such as intermediaries, 
representatives (Coleman 1990), brokers (Burt 2000) and a “strategic player” who maintain 
bridge ties (Granovetter 1973). Robey & Cousins (2005) point out that “the structure of B2B 
e-commerce intermediaries is socially shaped, rather than the product of purely economic 
forces” (p.225). Schultze & Orlikowski (2004) claim that the problem with studies on 
digitalization and relationships is that they mostly focus on organizational level and fail to 
consider that inter-firm relationships with stakeholders are initiated by actions and 
interactions of individual actors (e.g. sales people and customers) who represent these 
firms.  
Similar to discussions in legitimacy section, the opposing economic and social values 
leave their trace in social capital considerations as well. That is, between the rational 
theories that argue for arm’s length relations facilitated by the help of new technologies and 
relational theories that support social embeddedness through interpersonal relationships 
(Schultze & Orlikowski 2004). Interestingly, there is now an increasing body of literature that 
recognize these economic and social behaviours as complementary, despite the previous 
belief on their contradictoriness (Adler 2001; Granovetter 1985). It is argued that 
cooperative relationships and network technologies are indeed mutually reinforcing 
(Schultze & Orlikowski 2004).  
Trust 
Before discussing trust as a standalone concept, it is noteworthy to point out its visible role 
in both legitimation and social capital concepts that were previously discussed. There is an 
immense amount of scholarly contribution on the positive role of trust in facilitating the 
process of integration between digitalization and organization-customers relationships 
(Alsaad et al. 2017; Kim & Noh 2012; Robey & Cousins 2005; Schultze & Orlikowski 2004; 
Ulaga & Eggert 2006). However interestingly, many of the contributions in this area call 
attention to the indirect and moderating role that trust plays in this process (Alsaad et al. 
2017; Ulaga & Eggert 2006). Trust tends to have indirect effects such as increase in the 
likelihood of doing business in future (Ulaga & Eggert 2006) or moderating effects on 
perceived desirability of intent to adopt digitalization (Alsaad et al. 2017). 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
368 
However, there are also studies that do not recognize trust as a necessarily positive 
contributor in the transition process to digitalization. Alsaad et al. (2017) argue that the 
rigidities inherited in presence of trust, may hamper the flexibility of firm to acquire new 
technologies even if there are enough technological motivation to do so. They believe in 
balanced relationship structures that only ensure the positive and flexible side of trust when 
it comes to adopting new technologies (Alsaad et al. 2017). Moreover, there are also 
stimulating findings suggesting that trust is in fact not related to the supplier choice of 
professional buyers in industrial contexts. Such buyers instead rely on objective assessment 
measures such as superiority of supplier’s offering,  relative price/ cost and delivery 
performance (Doney & Cannon 1997; Ulaga & Eggert 2006) These propositions takes us back 
one last time, to the initial discussion on the opposing economic and social values. As it 
appears, the same struggle to find the balance between social and economic aspects is 
present in trust related factors in relationships as well. 
Discussion 
Two basic observations can be made from the scholarly contributions discussed in previous 
section. First, the evidence of how conceptually intertwined are the three notions of 
legitimacy, social capital and trust.  Second, the existence of opposing economic and social 
values when studying these relational factors in light of digitalization in NBMs.  
There are several undertaken studies in different contexts, with all having a goal in 
common, attempting to bridge the gap between social and economic values in order to 
benefit from their complementary nature. Granovetter (1985) calls for an optimal balance in 
types of relationships and believes that the companies should maintain few strong ties but 
many weak ties in order to be able to convert the produced social capital into economic 
capital. In line with this discussion, Kindström (2010) argues that it is not possible to 
maintain good relationships with all customers. As sometimes, the costs of maintaining 
those relationships exceeds their benefits. He therefore suggests that customers should be 
segmented in accordance to their strategic importance. This segmenting at times, may 
involve shifting some relationships back into a more transaction-based nature (Kindström 
2010). Moreover, there are many similar propositions arguing for concurrent operation of 
new and old business models (Schultze & Orlikowski 2004), business model portfolios 
(Sabatier et al. 2010), service offering portfolios (Kindström 2010) or hybrid exchanges with 
both traditional and digital capabilities (Robey & Cousins 2005) in order to manage the 
complementary nature of social and economic aspects. Last but not the least, the role of 
intermediaries that was briefly mentioned in social capital section, should not be neglected 
in management of this complementarity.  
One study that had been a constant source of inspiration in this paper, was the work of 
Robey & Cousins (2005). As already mentioned, Robey & Cousins (2005) introduced the idea 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
369 
that the revision of business models in light of digitalization, will result in an interplay 
between the opposing pressures of economic and social values.  They posited that this 
interplay can be between information transparency and privacy, opportunism and trust or 
between efficiency and legitimacy (Robey & Cousins 2005). After carrying out the study in 
this paper, the scholarly discussions on three relational factors of legitimacy, social capital 
and trust assisted us in further developing Robey & Cousins' (2005) proposition. First, if their 
proposition is viewed from a social capital perspective, an interesting revelation is the 
presence of all three means of social capital creation in Robey & Cousins’ argument. That is, 
the information flow, trust and norms (i.e. in which norms and values are the main elements 
of legitimacy). It can therefore be argued that on one side of the extreme of relationships 
lays embedded relations and this is where the social pressures are at their strongest. 
Moreover, on the other side lays the arm’s length relations where the presence of economic 
values are at their strongest.  
Second, in line with above discussion on presence of the three social capital creation 
means of information flow, trust and norms, this study argues that it will be an 
oversimplified view to consider these three elements independent from one another. As 
scholars in social capital studies believe that it is not possible to draw clear border lines 
between them (Nahapiet & Ghoshal 1998). Therefore, by having in mind the prospect of 
interdependency between these three elements, this study propose that it is possible for 
some of these opposing values to reinforce each other. There are studies that claim that 
transparency in information flow can lead to creation of trust (Akkermans et al. 2004). 
Existence of trust on the other hand, can lead to more transparency in information being 
shared between actors (Coleman 1990). In addition, trust in certain situations can lead to 
efficiency of outcomes (Valley et al. 1998). Efficiency in transactions on the other hand, may 
lead to trust building between the actors (Fukuyama 1995). Fig. 1 depicts the propositions 
that were made in this study by further developing Robey & Cousins’ (2005) argument. It 
may not be safe to claim that these reinforcing roles can exist between all other opposing 
values of privacy, opportunism and legitimacy as well. Nevertheless, these possibilities 
cannot be ruled out either. It is therefore that these linkages are presented in dashed-lines 
in Fig. 1.

Conclusion 
This study, focused on relational factors, which are believed to play an important role in the 
transition to NBMs in light of digitalization. The observation made, was the existence of an 
interplay between social and economic values when transitioning to NBMs in all three 
relational concepts of social capital, legitimacy and trust, which were the focus of this study. 
As mentioned in the beginning, this study has only acted as a starting point in theoretical 
development of NBMs with a relational focus. There is therefore, room for many further 
studies to gradually shape the theories in this area.  The first and foremost, is the need to 
have industry-specific research in this field. As it is not possible to provide a single recipe for 
all industries. The industry-specific characteristics of firms can highly influence the optimal 
balance that should exist between these economic and social extremes. Moreover, the 
industry-specific studies can also assist researchers in identifying the optimized extent of 
incorporating digitalization in company’s value proposition.  
Furthermore, a proposition was made in this paper in regard with the reinforcing role of 
opposing economic and social values in addition to their previously proposed 
complementary role. There is therefore need for further studies that support or reject this 
proposition, shed light on significance of each of these reinforcing roles or study them under 
an industry-specific context. Last but not the least is the need for more focused studies on 
the role of intermediaries that had been briefly touched upon in this paper. It is argued that 
intermediaries can play a critical role in business model transition process. Therefore, 
studies that further incorporate and discuss their role in managing stakeholders’

Abstract 
Problem/Idea 
Waste Management in the EU has in the past decade been guided by the 2008 directive 
(2008/98/EC) – itself a revision of the 2006 Waste Framework Directive (2006/12/EC). Now, 
however, a new and more ambitious package, the Circular Economy Package, including 
revised legislative proposals on waste, has been adopted (EC, 2015). This shift (from Waste 
Management to Circular Economy) underlines both the problem and a possible solution: In 
2013, total waste generation in the EU amounted to around 2.5 billion tons per year of 
which more than 60 percent were not reused or recycled; valorization of waste (as a 
resource or secondary raw material) would increase competitiveness, create a substantial 
number of new jobs, avoid a considerable amount of GHG emissions, and reduce EU 
dependency on material imports. 
For Denmark, long considered a pioneer in waste management despite it also being the 
EU country producing the most waste (759 kg per person in 2014, 60 percent higher than the 
EU average of 475 kg per person), the circular economy package introduces new challenges 
and opportunities. A very high fraction of the municipal waste in Denmark is being 
incinerated (54 percent), thus linking the waste system very closely with the energy system 
through highly effective and widespread district heating networks. However, despite being 
an effective way of waste management, such high rates of incineration are inconsistent with 
more ambitious recycling targets at EU, national and local levels.  
As is the case in most Danish cities, in Aalborg, the reliance on incineration as a waste 
management and energy producing strategy is high. Almost 23 percent (1467 TJ) of the 
energy used in the city’s district heating system comes from Reno Nord - the central waste 
incineration plant. Currently, for household waste, metal, plastics, glass, paper and carboard 

 
NBM@Graz2017

are source collected. The rest, namely the refuse waste, is sent for incineration. The organic 
fraction, one of the largest groups in municipal waste, is currently still disposed within the 
refuse material. 
Approach & Principles 
With the introduction of a new waste management plan, Denmark Without Waste 
(2012 to 2022), the city has begun its own transition – under the heading ‘Aalborg without 
Waste: 2014-2025’ – towards more re-use of discarded materials from households. One 
target to live up to is the national goal of 50% recycling. A goal that is not achievable without 
a strong focus on the organic fraction identifying solutions to on the one hand prevent for 
example food waste, and on the other valorize the waste created and prepare for recycling.  
In Aalborg, the new waste management plan is closely connected to political ambitions 
and goals for the transition towards a more sustainable future, and other official strategies 
and actions, such as Smart City Aalborg, the Sustainability Strategy and the Climate Strategy. 
It is also obvious, however, that the traditional and socially accepted model of waste 
incineration will need to be challenged, and that new solutions must be co-designed and co-
planned to close loops and promote zero-waste society. The principles of Circular Economy 
(especially as presented by Ellen MacArthur Foundation) inspires politically and 
administratively in Aalborg, and their model is thus point of departure for the understanding 
and discussions of the possible circularity and loop-closing. 
Case & Data 
To exemplify opportunities for embracing circular economy business models, we 
propose utilizing current district and project developments underway in the city, and in early 
planning and design phase integrate to the extent possible functions that support waste 
prevention and recycling. The project, Cloud City, currently under planning (and with 
expected first-dig mid-2017) has been selected for a potential first zero-organic waste site in 
Aalborg. The Cloud City project, named after the central art piece by Tomás Saraceno that is 
to be installed, is a brownfield development in Aalborg’s city center. It will transform a non-
working industrial area into a multi-functional urban center. The project includes functions 
such as art exhibition, housing, rooftop urban gardens, food markets, hotel, restaurants, a 
micro distillery, and a chocolate factory.  
A project this size and with these specific activities creates an opportunity for innovative 
design that focuses on closing loops in the organic resource and waste stream. To achieve a 
zero-waste district, the material flows must be identified and calculated, and resource 
utilization/treatment solutions needed proposed. The outflows were intended to be 
analysed through a material flow analysis, with data collected in a local context. However, 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
377 
due limited feedback from stakeholders, appropriated data collected through literature 
review were used instead. 
Design & Perspectives 
The organic waste output in Cloud City was estimated at 16.7 tons per month. Assuming 
a 25% reduction in food waste (due to food waste prevention strategies), the estimated 
amount of waste is 12.8 tons per month. The second phase of study (ending June 2017) is 
now underway aiming at identifying areas of opportunity and proposing ways to close 
organic waste loops. The second section is inspired by the concept of circular economy and 
value creation. The expected results include a proposal for organic waste treatment that 
contributes to the general ecological transition of the district (and if scaled, the city). 
Moreover, it is expected to create enough knowledge that promotes further research on the 
topic.  
Introduction 
Waste and the organic fraction 
Among the various aspects of sustainability, waste, specifically reduction and 
management, stand as one of the many imperative topics to be addressed. According to 
Hoornweg et al. (Hoornweg, Bhada-Tata, & Kennedy, 2013) , “waste is being generated 
faster than other environmental pollutants, including greenhouse gases”. The present waste 
generation rates are already causing relevant phenomenon such as the marine-debris “Great 
Pacific Garbage Patch” between Japan and the US west coast. However, if this is not 
worrying enough, it is calculated that global solid waste generation could triple in the 
following century if a “business as usual” system is maintained; going from 3.5 million 
tonnes per day in 2010, to 11 million tonnes per day in 2100 (Hoornweg et al., 2013). Under 
this context, it is possible to identify waste management as a “critical matter of public 
health, environmental quality, quality of life, and economic development” (The World Bank, 
2013).  
In a European context, waste management practices have been guided by the Waste 
Hierarchy and the EU Directives. The next figure shows the waste hierarchy (Figure 1) followed by 
the European Union. 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
378 
 
Figure 1- Waste Hierarchy 
Within the EU directives, the most important highlights related to waste are: the EU 
Directive on Landfill (1999/31/EC), the EU waste Directive (2006/12/EU), the revised EU 
waste directive (2008/98/EC) and finally the Circular Economy Package adopted in 2015. The 
latter contains proposals “on waste, with long-term targets to reduce landfilling and increase 
recycling and reuse” (The European Union, 2017).  
In cities, organic waste becomes a relevant fraction to consider for increasing recycling 
and reuse. Firstly, because on a global average, the organic fraction in municipal solid waste 
is 46% (Hoornweg & Bhada-Tata, 2012). Secondly, organic waste is linked to climate change 
due to methane emissions when decomposition takes place in landfills (European 
Commission, 2016). Thirdly, organic matter is concentrating in cities -due to urban area’s 
high consumption- with nutrients not being returned to the soil. This is causing soil 
degradation on a global scale, affecting one quarter of land globally with a cost of USD 40 
billion per year (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017). 
Denmark and Aalborg 
Denmark is not only the country with more municipal waste generation in the EU (759 
kg/person in 2014), it is also the second one regarding waste incineration (with 
54%)(Eurostat, 2016). Moreover, the country falls behind Germany and Austria (countries 
with similar GDP per capita in 2015) (Eurostat, 2017) in terms of waste treatment. Germany 
performed better in recycling (47% against 27%), while Austria performed better in 
composting (32% against 17%). Under this context, and considering EU policy, it becomes 
attractive the analysis of a possible shift from an incineration dominated management to 
one focusing on prevention, reuse and recycling. 
Given the circumstances, the Danish Government decided to take a new approach to 
waste management. On 2013, a new resource strategy “Denmark without Waste” was

implemented. With a motto “Recycle more- incinerate less”, the Danish Government opted 
to promote a series of actions, focused on household waste recycling, to modify waste 
management in Denmark in a 10-year period -from 2013- to 2022-. A core goal of the 
strategy is to achieve a 50% recycling rate in household waste (up from 22% in 2011) 
(Government, 2013) for selected waste streams (organic waste, paper, cardboard, glass, 
wood, plastics and metals). However, the process will take place at different rates across the 
country. This is mainly because “Municipalities are primarily responsible for the waste area, 
specially for household waste”(Government, 2013). And different municipalities may decide 
to take different approaches into fulfilling targets and objectives. In this context, the 
Denmark Without Waste Strategy specifies: “[…] the strategy contains no new requirements 
for individual municipalities. It will still be up to the individual municipality to set the level of 
service and organization of waste management” (Government, 2013). Therefore, focusing in 
a specific location, or municipality, becomes relevant when analyzing waste management 
further. 
Aalborg municipality is located in North Jutland and is Denmark’s third largest 
municipality. The city of Aalborg is the largest city in the municipality but also it is North 
Jutland’s capital. The city has actively participated in the European Conference on 
Sustainable Cities & Towns; events that have concluded in urban sustainability initiatives in 
the form of the Aalborg Charter in 1994, the Aalborg Commitments in 2014, and the Basque 
Declaration in 2016. In the latter, although many topics and scopes are mentioned, there is a 
strong connection with the concept of circular economy. This can be observed in some of 
the pathways statements stablished in the Declaration: “We will turn the challenges in front 
of us into opportunities for our local economies”, “We will create and close local value 
chains”, or “We will pursue the development towards a Circular Economy” (Declaration, 
2016).  
Approximately 129,000 tons of household waste were collected in Aalborg municipality 
in 2014 (Forsyning, 2014). This corresponds to 1,256 kg per household. According to the 
same report, the waste treatment for the same year was: 50.5% incineration, 44.4% 
recycling and 5.08% Landfill. Incineration is carried out by Reno Nord, in a local plant that 
burns waste from five different municipalities. From all the waste incinerated, the waste 
coming from Aalborg’s municipality came primarily from the “refuse” category and from fuel 
waste (~72% and ~28% respectively)(Forsyning, 2014). The refuse category, which is entirely 
incinerated, refers to municipal waste that is left after separating things to recycle -such as 
paper, carton, plastics, metal, glass- and hazardous waste. Household organic waste is 
considered as non-recyclable, and therefore is separated within the refuse fraction along 
with items such as dipers, pizza boxes and multi-layered containers (chips, milk and juice 
cartons).  

 
NBM@Graz2017

In this situation, it is possible to observe that the organic waste fraction is: 1) not 
collected separately, 2) it’s collected inside the refuse category which normally contains 
non-recyclables, 3) it is incinerated entirely. Considering compliance with the national 
recycling targets for 2022 (of at least 50%), then it is possible to observe an area of 
opportunity regarding waste in Aalborg. The following graph (Figure 2) shows the 
incinerated refuse waste in Aalborg’s plant (with data until 2015) and a linear forecast until 
the year 2022. A second line has been established to show the expected decrease in 
incinerated refuse waste if 50% of organic waste is being recycled by 2022 (considering that 
organic waste recycling nowadays is 0%). 
Figure 2- Incinerated refuse waste in Aalborg's plant - BAU vs Organic recycling target 
for 2022 
The difference between the two scenarios that can be addressed through the design 
and implementation of innovative solutions. The solutions should be focused in the 
promotion of waste prevention, reuse and recycling -closing loops- above other options. 
Moreover, proposed solutions should not only need to be innovative, but should be able to 
break the present waste treatment trends on which the City, and the country, are at the 
moment. However, before designing potential solutions, a holistic understanding of the 
situation in Aalborg is needed. 
The fact that organic waste is incinerated not only prevents waste recycling and reuse, 
but also links the waste sector with the energy one; particularly in the area of district 
heating. Reno Nord is one of the main contributors to Aalborg’s District Heating system 
along with Aalborg Portland and Nordjylland Power Station (Nordjyllandsværket). According 
to Aalborg Varme (from Aalborg Forsyning), in 2014, the heat supply to the District Heating 
system was as following: Nordjylland Power Station with 56%, Reno Nord with 23%, Aalborg 
Portland with 18%, and 3% coming from the reserves (Aalborg Forsyning, 2017). In this

context, the importance of waste within the energy sector creates a circumstance where 
different interests, of different stakeholders, might compete. Moreover, this competition 
could slow down the ecological transition that the city is experiencing at the moment.  
Therefore, the analytical framework will analyze Aalborg in terms of ecological 
modernization and institutional theory. Moreover, additional information will be given in 
terms of Circular Economy and Value Creation for organic waste. 
Analytical Framework 
Ecological Modernization 
The sociological theory of Ecological Modernization will be used to provide a general 
framework on the current situation in Aalborg regarding its green transition. It should be 
highlighted that it is not the purpose to engage in a theoretical questioning or development 
approach; but simply into a descriptive task. According to Mol and Sonnenfeld (Mol & 
Sonnenfeld, 2000), Ecological Modernization appeared as an attempt to provide 
explanations regarding environmental transformations in practices, discourses and 
institutions. The theory was first developed in the beginnings of the 1980’s, and has been, 
since then, under constant transformations due to multiple scientists contributing with 
various publications. Nevertheless the constant changes, at the core, “the theory tries to 
analyze how contemporary industrialized societies deal with environmental crisis”(Mol & 
Sonnenfeld, 2000).  
In general terms, it can be argued that the approach in Aalborg is that of relating the 
“social” with the “natural”. The very creation of the Center for Green transition (Center for 
Grøn Omstilling) in 2013, shows how the institutional context is constantly evolving due to 
environmental-induced changes. This approach is influenced by the EU policy, the Danish 
strategies and the city’s commitments (Ex. Basque declaration), and is reflected in the 
specific approach of Aalborg’s municipality. The municipality’s Sustainability strategy is 
focused on “consumption and resources and how SMART solutions based on circular 
economy can create green growth and social development in the municipality”(Aalborg 
Kommune, 2017). In general, the strategy aims to benefit citizens, businesses and the 
environment at the same time. Moreover, other initiatives, such as the Green Agents 
(Grønne Agenter) -which support to citizen-driven initiatives- and the Green Stores (Grøn 
Butik) -an environmental labelling scheme-, relate the social and the natural within the 
already stablished institutions. Considering this context, it is possible to argue that the 
approach of the city is closer to a moderate position rather than a radical one. The 
municipality’s sustainable initiatives support the idea of a need for reforms and transitions, 
but always within the current capitalist system. Furthermore, apparently, the sustainable 
strategy does not prioritize the environment above or below the social; rather they seem to 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
382 
have the same importance. In the municipality’s web information it states when referring to 
the sustainability strategy focus: “it combines the desire for a sustainable transition with the 
citizens’ well-being and quality of life” (Aalborg Kommune, 2017).  
In the context of waste, changes towards an ecological transition are evident. Regarding 
household waste, paper, cardboard and glass were already being separately collected by the 
municipality. And just recently, the streams of plastic and metal were added up to this list. 
This recent institutional change facilitates the possibility of increasing recycling and reducing 
incineration. However, when analyzing in greater detail, this is not the case for organic waste 
yet.  
In general terms, although the city appears to be through a holistic process of ecological 
modernization (supported by EU policy, Danish policy and the municipality’s strategies), 
there appears to be conflict that slows down the progression in terms of organic waste. 
Organic waste, along with other refuse material, is being incinerated. Considering that 
plastics and metals are currently being recycled in a higher percentage, a further reduction 
in waste going to incineration could represent a challenge in terms of energy supply. In this 
case, involved institutions could influence the path the city is going to take in the future.  
Moreover, political aspects influence the process as well. According to Dorte Ladefoged 
(Ladefoged, 2017), Waste Planner from Aalborg’s Municipality, the city is planning on 
implementing biogas solutions in the close future. However, there are two reasons that 
prevented a separate collection of the organic fraction during the last years: 
1. There is concern about the cleanness of the pulp (due to the presence of plastic 
material) produced in anaerobic digestion processes. The presence of plastic 
complicates the process of defining the “accepted values” for disposing pulp in the 
soil, along with defining where or to whom is the pulp going to be delivered. In this 
matter, currently there is no regulation in Denmark that stablishes limits. Thus, the 
decision is taken by the local government. 
2. Joined to the previous point, future government changes also slow down the process. 
Elections are happening in 2017, and a new government bureau is expected for 2018. 
In this case, certain decisions, such as organic waste treatment, will be addressed 
until the new government comes (in order to avoid contradicting points of view 
between the past and new administration).  
All things considered, a combination of circumstances is creating conflict among 
stakeholders that slows down the ecological modernization process in the waste setting. 
This conflict might be explained by the combination of both: the relationship of the waste 
and energy sectors, and the current political uncertainty (including future changes and the 
definition of limit values for pulp from anaerobic digestion processes). The previously 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
383 
mentioned aspects involve the interaction of different institutions in Aalborg. These 
institutions might be competing to each other. Even more, certain institutions might be 
influenced by multiple factors the slow down the process of ecological modernization in 
terms of waste. Therefore, in order to describe and analyze this conflict, institutional theory 
will be used. 
Institutions in Aalborg 
In general terms, Institutional theory analyses the structures in society that shape and guide 
human behavior through systems such as laws, norms, common beliefs, etc. Such structures, 
which might seem static, can arise, transform and even disappear. Institutions are part of 
these structures. 
According to Scott (Scott, 2001), the institutional characteristics are given by the 
“building blocks”: regulative, normative and cultural-cognitive elements. The regulative, 
normative and cultural-cognitive elements conform what is known as the three pillars of 
Institutions. All of them are related to each other and sometimes they fall on a process of 
mutual reinforcing. Nevertheless, they are often separated since scholars, with different 
approaches, usually give a primary importance to a single pillar. 
Even though all three elements might be seen as divergent conceptions (mainly to 
underlying assumptions, mechanisms and indicators (Scott, 2001)), in this present paper an 
integrated conception will be used. This means that all three elements are going to be 
considered equally relevant. Furthermore, the description will include different levels of 
analysis (from world system to organization sub-system). In this way, the current 
institutional situation of Aalborg will be explained. 
The waste situation in Aalborg is characterized by conflict within different institutions 
that slow down the process of Ecological Modernization. Furthermore, the conflict is 
heightened by the relationship among the energy and waste sectors. This relationship 
among different institutions promotes a situation where behavior is guided differently 
depending on particular interests. Thus, having multiple conceptions of how society should 
develop slows down ecological progress. In this context, institutions in Aalborg will be 
identified within the three pillars. 
On the regulative approach, actions are guided by coercive mechanisms through rules, 
laws and sanctions. Regarding waste in Aalborg, regulation can be seen all the way up to EU 
policy (specifically the EU directives), Denmark’s Waste Strategies (Denmark without waste) 
and the local government in Aalborg. In the case of the EU directives, behavior is shaped by 
formal law; which in case of non-commitment could signify sanctions. In the case of Danish 
strategies, behavior is shaped by rules. And even if there are no proper sanctions to failing 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
384 
targets, a case of non-commitment could be related to negative consequences.  These two, 
EU and Danish regulation, are now focusing on the prioritization of waste prevention, reuse 
and recycling, and a general reduction on landfill and incineration. This stablishes clear 
objectives on the energy and waste sectors in Aalborg. However, conditions for the local 
government institution are not that clear. It should be considered that the waste targets are 
established on national level but the municipality is open to deal with the problem in their 
own way. In this context, according to Dorte Ladefoged (Ladefoged, 2017), in Aalborg, 
politicians represent the main stakeholder which decides what to do and how far to go. 
Coincidently,  waste is now very popular in politics (Ladefoged, 2017). Thus, it is very likely 
that the local government implements rules and laws that fall in line with the approach 
taken by the regulation on EU and Danish levels. In this case, it would seem like the 
regulative institutions direct themselves into the same direction. However, the local 
government perception is influenced by other factors. This open the opportunity of 
decisions being made based on a normative or cultural-cognitive approach (something that 
might signify conflict when analyzed further).  
On the normative approach, actions are guided by normative mechanisms through 
certifications/accreditation or pressure of social obligation. As an example, let’s consider the 
European Union, but now through the Circular Economy Package. So far, the package is 
integrated by revised legislative proposals and an action plan. In this context, the proposals, 
as a whole, do not represent a formal rule or policy. Therefore, the European norms can be 
considered as something that is socially expected (through pressure of other environmental 
legit institutions) in a normative setting. In this context, the circular economy concept would 
promote a scenario with more recycling of waste. Nevertheless, in this pillar, other 
institutions might share, or not, the same point of view. As mentioned before, social 
obligation is relevant. However, such social obligation is created by several institutions which 
expect to guide actions based on different approaches. As an example of this, and 
considering the waste-energy connection in Aalborg, the European Sustainable Cities 
Platform would support a transition to more recycling, while Reno Nord might support the 
supply of services (district heating).  In the same context, such differences on what is 
“socially obliged” would create conflict within the local government. Politicians, in this case 
people deciding what is going to happen, might take different points of view. This 
circumstance could slow down the ecological transition process within Aalborg.  
Additionally, in the normative approach, a moral aspect provides legitimacy. And morality is 
created within society through institutions. In this matter, the cultural-cognitive is 
intertwined with the normative approach. 
On the cultural-cognitive approach, actions are guided through mimetic mechanisms 
through common beliefs and shared logics/understanding. What becomes culturally 
supported is what guides future processes. On one hand, In Aalborg, and Denmark in 
general, there is a strong historical incineration approach to waste. Even more, the 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
385 
incineration processes are closely linked to the District heating systems which provide 
energy to households in a specific country with specific weather conditions. In such context, 
incineration can be seen as something that is taken for granted (therefore being mimicked) 
as the best (and maybe only) solution to the waste challenge. On the other hand, another 
part of the population could be aware of different methods to treat organic waste and could 
support their reproduction (treatment processes in other countries for example). In general, 
what is common belief depends almost in each person and in what they consider to be legit. 
This is the same case for politicians which could support different approaches to organic 
waste treatment. 
A conflict between the three pillars of institutions is evident in Aalborg. Firstly, there 
is a regulative set of institutions pushing strategies that, in general terms, intend to reduce 
incineration. Secondly, another set of institutions, on a normative level, might legitimize 
actions towards circular economy but also to the supply of services -such as district heating- 
and the provision of jobs. In this context, it is morally accepted to incinerate waste in order 
to supply the city’s energy demands. Thirdly, in the cultural-cognitive level, incineration 
could be -or not- supported by the population depending on the specific group of people. 
The historic use of incineration in the country could represent a solution that comes from a 
“common understanding”. However, recent changes on regulative and normative levels, 
could modify these cultural-cognitive institutions into bodies that support prevention, reuse 
and recycling. Considering all pillars: a) the regulative might contradict the normative and 
the cultural-cognitive, b) the normative might have contradictions within what is morally 
accepted (what is socially obliged), but also might differ from the regulative and cultural 
cognitive, and c) the cultural-cognitive might have contradictions within what is understood 
as “normal behavior” and what should be mimicked; plus having differences with the 
normative and regulative levels.  
All pillars of institutions are intertwined. Even more, differences arise within the same 
institutional levels (ex. variances inside cultural-cognitive). Thus, the differences, in what is 
considered legit, create a conflict that slows down the general sustainable transition of the 
city. In this context, it is necessary to initiate a new trend in a way that addresses the waste 
challenge considering these conflicts. Under the assumption that reducing incineration is the 
best option, waste treatment solutions should have as an objective to align the different 
institutional pillars. This means that actions towards incineration reduction should be 
socially accepted and validated. Support from people would provide proper legitimization, 
which in turn, would promote potential environment-induced changes in the present 
institutions in Aalborg.

Circular Economy and Value 
Circular Economy is about leaving behind the linear economic model that has been around 
since the industrial revolution. The linear model is based on the assumption of unlimited 
inputs to production and consumption systems. However, recent pressure on resources, 
such as materials and energy, have led to the awareness that the number of available 
resources in the world is limited. In order to decouple resource scarcity from economic 
development, the obsolete linear model has to be substituted by a new approach. In this 
context, the concept of Circular Economy is highlighted. According to the Ellen MacArthur 
Foundation, Circular Economy  “is one that is restorative and regenerative by design and 
aims to keep products, components, and materials at their highest utility and value at all 
times, distinguishing between technical and biological cycles” (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 
2015). In more detail, to keep the “highest utility and value at all times”, an economic model 
which includes recirculation (circles rather than lines) of products, components and 
materials is proposed (see Figure 3 for Circular Economy Figure). 
Following the Circular Economy definition and principles, it is possible to link the 
circularity concept with Value Creation. If production systems are going to implement 
Circular Economy principles, then a restructuration of the supply chain needs to take place. 
It is in the new structure than value opportunities need to be identified and exploited. For 
example, one of the characteristics of Circular Economy is that “waste does not exist, and is

Materials. Source: (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2014) 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
387 
designed out by intention” (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015). In this scenario, a company 
may be confronted with the need to creating value for spare materials. 
The opportunities and mechanisms to implement the Circular Economy model in the 
biological cycles have been mostly unexplored (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017). “For 
biological materials, the essence of value creation lies in the opportunity to extract additional 
value from products and materials by cascading them through other applications” (Ellen 
MacArthur Foundation, 2015). In this context, cascading refers to the potential to diversify 
reuse when compared to just landfilling. This becomes the only option since, in contrast with 
technical cycles, biological materials are “designed” to be consumed and then be used 
directly to regenerate the new raw materials. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that this 
does not close the opportunity for waste prevention strategies. For the specific stream of 
organic municipal waste, the cascading to other applications could include: the production 
of concentrated NPK fertilizers (such as composting), energy recovery through anaerobic 
digestion, and the manufacture of products and materials traditionally derived from fossil 
fuels (ex. biorefineries) (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017). 
Considering the need to recycle organic waste in Aalborg, the present state of ecological 
modernization, the potential conflict among institutions and the multiple options to create 
value, it was decided to develop a proposal for a possible solution. In order to narrow down 
the scope of the research, it was decided to select a specific location for further analysis. 
This means that the present paper won’t aim at changing the whole waste system in 
Aalborg, but will only aim at initiating a transition, through changes in a specific location, 
into a city with less incineration of organic waste. The location is defined by a new project 
that is under development called Cloud City. Cloud City is located in Aalborg’s city center, 
and is integrated by a series of activities -within specific boundaries- that will generate 
municipal organic waste. Since the Cloud City project is currently under development, an 
area of opportunity is open to bring innovation. 
Once the location and the problem were identified, the research statement and the 
research questions were established: 
Closing loops in Cloud City: A zero-organic waste district in Aalborg. 
a. What are the expected solid organic waste flows in Cloud City? 
b. How to treat the organic waste output and what value can it bring?

Methodology 
The present paper will develop a Case Study provided that the project happens in a real-life 
context, that it has defined boundaries -and therefore can be considered a defined unit of 
analysis-, and that the research will include a detailed analysis. In more detail, the present 
Case Study will take a problem-oriented approach -focusing on the “how to act”- rather than 
a cause/consequence analysis. 
Case Study 
Cloud City is a brownfield project currently under development -with expected first-dig mid 
2017- in the western area of Aalborg’s City center. The name is inspired by the central art 
piece, by Tomás Saraceno, that is going to be installed. In general terms, the Cloud City 
project will transform a non-working industrial area (previously a historical aquavit distillery 
that finished operations in 2014) into a multifunctional urban center.   
The Cloud City project is expected to become an iconic center for art, innovation, smart 
solutions and sustainability, while preserving the historic identity of the city. The project 
aims at creating a vibrant space that brings life to the city by attracting residents (through 
housing), as well as local and foreign visitors. Furthermore, development will be divided into 
two: preservation of old industrial buildings and construction of new infrastructure. The 
following image (Figure 4), taken from the “Spritfabrikken I Aalborg” report (2016) from 
Bjarke Ingels Group, shows how Cloud City may look in the future. It shows the expected 
preserved old industrial buildings (red bricks) along with the new constructions.

Cloud City is being developed by Martin Nielsen and by A. Engaard A/S. The project is 
expected to include functions such as: a theater, rooftop urban gardens, a food market, 
hotels, restaurants, a micro-destillery, art galleries, housing and a chocolate factory. 
Including everything, the total built area is approximately 75,000 m2, and corresponds to a 
building percentage of 157% (Kommune, 2015). A report from Ramboll estimates, that in the 
first year, 1.6 million people will visit Cloud City (Ramboll, n.d.). Out of this number, it was 
estimated that 748,000 would correspond to “unique and paying visitors”, of which 10% 
would be foreign.  
By looking at the multiple activities within the area, it is possible to observe that many 
of the systems will be future sources of organic waste. This organic waste, which would fall 
on the classification of municipal waste, would mainly come from households, 
commercial/services, green areas/gardening and external sources (waste brought by 
visitors). In this context, the area could rely on the municipality for collecting the waste, or it 
could implement its own approach which may initiate a more radical change by breaking 
present trends in waste treatment. 
Data Collection 
In the present work, a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods is going to be 
used. The methods for data collection include literature review, interviews, surveys and 
mathematical calculations. Different methods and concepts will be used to answer the main 
research question and sub-questions. The following table (Table 1) will specify the methods 
and concepts used to answer the questions, and will give details on how data was collected.

For the first sub-question, the first step was to identify the organic waste sources within 
Cloud City. Sources will be identified by analyzing data provided by the developers and maps 
of the site. Once the sources are identified, other data can be estimated. The research 
design for data gathering will carry out: a) personal contact with relevant services in Aalborg 
(such as chocolate factory, hotels and restaurants), and b) contact through phone and email 
to services not found in Aalborg but which are present in other parts of Denmark (such as 
food courts). Brief unstructured interviews will be used in local services, while surveys would 
be done for long distance communication. It is intended to obtain information in the most 
“local context” with the purpose of providing validity to the calculations. Literature review 
will be used to obtain the missing data. 
Once the estimations for outputs are calculated, a proposal will be developed on how to 
treat the waste. This proposal is going to be described in the discussion section of the 
present paper and will answer the second sub-question. The proposal is going to be 
developed based on the concept of circular economy and value creation (briefly explained in 
the analytical framework) and will promote an ecological transition in synergy with the local 
institutions. Finally, the potential value will be identified in terms of the three bottom line 
aspects: social, environmental and economic. 
Results 
Waste Sources 
To perform the flow analysis of organic waste in Cloud City, the first step was to identify the 
“processes” that could generate organic waste. To identify such processes, a specific 
procedure was carried out. First, a map of Cloud City was analyzed and buildings were 
identified. Then, each building was categorized in “Primary”, “Secondary” or “housing”. The 
classification was done based on the specific developers of each area and on the expected 
waste output. The buildings categorized as Primary and Secondary are being developed by 
Martin Nielsen. Primary refers to the buildings with the most expected waste output, while 
the secondary buildings are expected to have a small output. “Housing” is being developed 
by A. Engaard. All buildings in this category are houses, except for grocery store, and 
therefore it was decided to label them in a different category. The considered buildings were 
then analyzed further to identify the specific activities that are planned inside. Finally, the 
activities were analyzed to define the processes that could generate organic waste. 
The following image (Figure 5)(based on the Spritfabrikken I Aalborg strategy report pg. 
14) (Bjarke Ingels Group, 2016) shows the expected plans for Cloud City, and highlights the 
considered buildings of the project.

In more detail, each building is composed of at least one activity; and each activity of at 
least one process. The following table (Table 3) shows the primary buildings “processes” that 
were considered in the calculations. Most data was gathered from the “Spritfabrikken I 
Aalborg” strategy report from Bjarke Ingles Group (Bjarke Ingels Group, 2016) and by 
information provided by Martin Nielsen, developer of the Cloud City Project.

Secondary elements are considered to have very small organic waste outputs. In this 
context, secondary elements are not going to be taken into account as organic waste 
sources. 
The processes for housing elements are simply household. The following table (Table

Waste Outputs 
Once the organic waste sources were identified, the next step was to estimate the waste 
flows in the system. Initially, it was expected to use the concept of Material Flow Analysis to 
describe the organic waste “digestion” in Cloud City. However, due to time constrains and 
the specific needs of the present work, it was decided to focus on the Organic Material 
Outputs only (and not consider inputs or stock). Therefore, the study didn’t carry out a 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
394 
Material Flow Analysis, but considered only material outputs of each process within Cloud 
City. The decision was made since it was considered that having the output information 
would be enough to design a solution for organic waste recycling. In this case, having the 
output calculation would allow to calculate the size of needed infrastructure and potential 
energy production. 
Gathering data from local sources, as expected from the research design (see Data 
collection section on page, was the main challenge. Contact in person was stablished with 
local hotels and chocolate shops. Contact by phone and email was stablished with a 
chocolate factory, hotels, a recycling company and food courts/food markets. No data was 
gathered from any of this sources since: a) they didn’t have the information or b) No answer 
was given after several contact attempts. Therefore, the output calculation is completely 
based on literature review assumptions (see Annex in page for full list of assumed values) 
and assuming the project has been running for 5 years. The expected waste outputs for the 
different processes are summarized in the following table (Table 5):

* No data was not found in literature review or other sources. Moreover, it was considered to be negligible and 
therefore was not accounted for.  
**Green areas waste is not considered in the calculation since this waste can be collected by the municipality 
and taken into compost. This is the normal procedure for garden waste in the municipal fraction in Aalborg. 
The estimated total output of organic waste, in year 5, in Cloud City is: 16.7 tons per 
month. However, this number might change if we consider present, and future, strategies 
that target organic waste prevention. For example, considering the United Nations 
Sustainability Goals, there is an adopted target to reduce the per capita food waste, in retail 
and consumer level, by 50% by 2030 (European Commission, 2017). In this matter, European 
countries are committed in fulfilling this target. As a second example, Denmark, in an 
exemplary change within the European countries, has cut down food waste in 25% in the 
period between 2011-2016 (Senet, 2016). If we consider both facts, and assume the values 
in 2011 as the initial period when considering the UN targets, it could be assumed that the 
country would need to reduce an extra 25% of food waste by 2030.  
According to the Cloud City’s project developers, the area is going to be managed in a 
sustainable and responsible way. Assuming prevention strategies are going to be 
implemented, and considering the targets for 2030, it was decided to stablish a 25% 
reduction in the calculated organic waste output number for restaurants, apartments and 
the food market. Therefore, the total organic waste output in Cloud City would be 12.8 tons 
per month, or 153.6 tons per year. 
Discussion 
The calculated amounts of generated organic waste in Cloud City are approximations. This is 
expected since the information, regarding the place and its planned developments, was 
limited. Moreover, the information which was expected to be gathered in a local 
environment was not provided by the stakeholders. Therefore, as a last resource, the data 
was calculated assuming a variety of numerical assumptions based on literature review.  
Most of the information was gathered from Danish sources, however, there are some 
sources based in other geographical contexts. In this context, the accuracy, and therefore 
the validity, of the numbers becomes questionable. Nevertheless, the importance of having 
such assumptions resides in the possibility of estimating potential treatment options and 
their possible impact. Even more, this could serve as a starting point for planning waste 

 
NBM@Graz2017

management details -such as waste collection-, or for estimating the whole impact of 
developing such a project in Aalborg. In this particular case, specific attention is given to 
waste treatment.  
Following the concept of circular economy, and value creation through cascading, 
possible solutions for waste treatment in the area include: Anaerobic Digestion and Aerobic 
composting. Both solutions would provide a higher value -when discussed in terms of the 
waste hierarchy- if compared to the current trend of incineration. Considering this, it is 
intended to design the basis for a waste treatment solution based on Anaerobic Digestion 
(see Notes) that would benefit the ecological transition of the city, while possible setting 
common goals among institutions.  
Notes 
The waste output calculation would serve as a basis for designing a proposal for waste 
treatment in Cloud City. However, the proposal is not finished yet at the time this paper was 
submitted. The reason for this is that the present work is based on a Master Thesis paper 
that is begin developed by the author as part of his studies (from February to June 2017). 
Therefore, the second sub-question is not answered in the present work. However, it is 
intended to include this last section in the final Master Thesis paper. The last draft will 
include the proposal basis along with an identification of the total value a project like would 
bring to the City. 
For further information it is recommended to contact the author through email. 
Conclusion 
Organic waste treatment through recycling solutions is the trend for Denmark for the future. 
This statement is supported by the regulation on EU level, the national level and by the 
municipal objectives. Even though the road towards less incineration seems clear, the 
process has been slow. In general, the ecological transition of Aalborg, in terms of waste, has 
been slowed down by different institutions -and their different pillars- including politicians 
and the waste/energy sectors. Therefore, waste treatment solutions should integrate 
institutional differences in their design, while creating the most value possible.  
Providing a localized solution in Cloud City not only creates a zero-organic waste district 
in the city of Aalborg, but also builds the foundations towards a transitions towards less 
incineration. A project with this dimensions works as a knowledge creator that not only 
could benefits the city, but also the municipality and the country in the long term.

Workshop 1 
Designing Sustainable Businesses with the Honeycomb Business 
Model Design Tool: Stakeholder cells 
Organized by Karen Miller 
Karen offers a 90 minute hands-on experience developed through an iterative process with 
practitioners and academics. The workshop will focus on the principal stage in Sustainable 
Business Model Innovation (SBMI) of understanding stakeholders within a business value 
network, and the value forms and exchanges. 
Participants will be guided through the process using a short case-study example. Next, 
working in groups, participants will tackle step-by-step a live SBMI challenge using 
stakeholder mapping and segmentation techniques. Then using cellular templates and 
instructions, key stakeholders identified in the previous exercise will be co-created as 
personas. Subsequently each group will interrogate and plot using their personas the value 
exchanges across the stakeholder network. These exchanges and relationships across the 
business’ value network will be captured visually. The workshop will culminate with groups 
ideating a ‘seedling’ value proposition in response to the live challenge using the knowledge 
they have generated through the process. 
Through the workshop participants will help to refine the process and materials, which 
are part of an overall Cambridge sustainable business model toolkit. 
Personas for sustainability 
Personas are fictitious representations, typically of end-users (customers), that are widely 
used in product/user interface design and marketing. Karen has refined classical persona 
development techniques in order to unearth a broader set of stakeholders’ specific needs in 
relation to value within business’ networks, with stakeholders expanded to include society 
and the environment (Evans et al. 2017). Innovation opportunities may be revealed by more 
clearly understanding stakeholders and how value flows; value may be in tangible and 
intangible forms, and in complex bundles. 
The personas help not only in the initial business model innovation phase but also in 
designing experiments to test business model assumptions. Experiments provide a more 
rapid and cost effective method of learning what will resonate with stakeholders’ needs.

Workshop 2 
Values-Based Innovation Management - Tools and Methods to 
Innovate by What We Care About 
Organized by Florian Lüdeke-Freund (facilitator) and Henning Breuer 
Henning and Florian demonstrate a business model innovation process based on real cases. 
Using exercises, content, and templates of the Business Innovation Kit and Sustainability 
Innovation Pack we will model sustainability-oriented new business. These tools have been 
developed and are iteratively refined in numerous workshops with innovation managers, 
start-ups, researchers, and students. They contain exercises to clarify values, facilitate 
ideation and refinement of business model components, scenarios to challenge assumptions 
and additional content to spell out the customer journey or revenue models. They are now 
available in English, German, Spanish and Polish. A basic download version in English is 
available for free: www.uxberlin.com/starter_kit. 
A values-based view on innovation 
Every human and every company holds values, but these notions of the desirable remain 
widely untapped as sources of and drivers for innovation. We take a values-based view on 
innovation and its management (based on Breuer & Lüdeke-Freund, 2017). We demonstrate 
the potential of values to integrate diverse stakeholders into innovation processes, to direct 
collaborative efforts, and to generate innovations that matter. Reframing existing methods 
and techniques allows us to realise ideals by the means of business, and to drive innovations 
that cater to what we really care about. 
Learn how to model values-based business: 
 We take a values-based view on innovation management, and introduce a self-
explanatory workshop format with gamification elements to model new business. 
 In a 90-minutes session we demonstrate the card-based Business Innovation Kit at 
work. In small groups you will experience each step in the process. 
 Participants will learn a new method for sustainability-oriented remodelling of 
existing businesses, and a set of exercises for various application domains. 
Who may wish to attend: 
 Practitioners with an interest to expand into new markets based on a reconsideration 
of their own values and those of their key stakeholders.

Workshop 3 
Exploring Model for the Organization of the Circular Economy 
Organized by Hans Stegeman 
The circular economy (CE) is mostly studied at the firm-level leading to insights in 
organizational and design principles. Circular Business Models can be seen as the micro 
building blocks of the circular economy. Existing business cases, different typologies and 
policy papers deliver the scattered evidence of what in the end sums up to a circular macro 
economy. A conceptual understanding of CE on meso and macro levels is however also 
highly needed, since there is a belief that these micro practices lead to sustainable 
development on a higher (systems) level. Yet the empirical proof for that claim is 
insubstantial. There is no structured insight into what constitutes a circular economy on a 
meso or macro level. The question we want to address in the workshop is how circular 
businesses work together: how do they close value cycles? What are the effects on added 
values, on sustainable outcomes and on the structure of chains? There is no clear empirical 
evidence on these questions. However, there is a lot of scattered knowledge, especially in 
the head of people working on business models. 
This workshop sets out to explore and develop a System Dynamics (SD) model for the 
CE-value cycle using a Group Model Building (GMB) approach. We consider SD to be a 
suitable approach to address this conceptual problem, as it helps to conceptualize a system 
model with closed feedback loops. 
The 90 minutes of the workshop will be a crash course in participating in real-life model 
building. Participants are invited to actively bring in their knowledge. Participants’ 
contributions will be synthesized in a causal loop diagram, clarifying interrelations and 
feedback loops between different elements. Knowledge on business models is very helpful 
to make a next step in understanding the circular economy: from business models to value 
cycles. 
The workshop forms part of a PhD project at the Nijmegen School of Management 
(Radboud University – The Netherlands).

Workshop 4 
Identifying Value Opportunities with the Sustainable Value Analysis 
Tool 
Organized by Doroteya Vladimirova (facilitator) and Miying Yang 
The Sustainable Value Analysis Tool addresses a critical need for tools that can help 
companies integrate issues and opportunities related to sustainability into business model 
innovation. Working through the concepts of value captured and uncaptured, the tool can 
help companies understand both the positive (value captured) and negative (value 
uncaptured) aspects of their current business models and identify value creation 
opportunities presented by both. 
Many companies think rather narrowly about value creation and where value may be 
found, focusing only on customer value (value in the eyes of the customers) and value 
created in production. The Sustainable Value Analysis Tool can change mindsets about what 
is regarded as value and open participants’ eyes to a wider universe of value opportunities. 
In this way, the tool provides a new lens through which companies can understand value and 
a structured approach to discovering value opportunities embedded in a sustainability-
focused approach to business model innovation. 
The Sustainable Value Analysis Tool was developed to help companies discover new 
value opportunities by identifying value that had been uncaptured by key stakeholders 
across the entire product life cycle. The tool has been used for sustainable business model 
innovation in numerous companies from various sectors. In this workshop, the organizer will 
demonstrate the use of the tool and lead participants through an example case study during 
the session. The workshop is hands-on; all participants will use the tool to identify new value 
opportunities and learn how to integrate sustainability into business model innovation with 
the tool. The Sustainable Value Analysis tool has been integrated in a broader research 
programme on sustainable business models run at the Centre for Industrial Sustainability, 
Institute for Manufacturing at the University of Cambridge.

Epilogue 
The International Conference on New Business Models had two successful editions. The first 
one was organized in 2016 at Toulouse Business School (France) and focused on "Exploring a 
changing view on organizing value creation”. The second, NBM@Graz2017 at University of 
Graz, covered the topic of “Exploring a changing view on value creation: Developing New 
Business Models". Looking closer at NBM@Graz2017, we had a great variety of ideas 
organized in 8 sessions and 4 workshops: 
Session 1:  
Organising Business Models for the Circular Economy 
Session 2:  
New Business Models, Sustainable Development and Corporate Strategic 
 
 
Management 
Session 3:  
Managing Sustainability-Oriented Business Models: Frameworks, Tools, and 
 
 
Cases 
Session 4:  
Business Models for Social Entrepreneurship 
Session 5:  
Business Models in the Age of Digitalisation 
Session 6:  
Crafting Regional Business Models 
Session 7:  
Insights on Business Models from Young Academics 
Session 8:  
When Business Models Have To Be Explained In Corporate Reporting 
 
Workshop 1:  Designing Sustainable Businesses with the Honeycomb Business Model Design 
 
 
Tool: Stakeholder cells 
Workshop 2:  Values-Based Innovation Management – Tools and Methods to Innovate by 
 
 
What We Care About 
Workshop 3:  Exploring a model for the organization of the Circular Economy 
Workshop 4:  Identifying Value Opportunities with the Sustainable Value Analysis Tool 
 
Altogether, at NBM@Graz2017 we had a great variety of topics that have relevance for both 
academia and practice. The ideas presented here are valuable contributions to the field, for 
which we would like to thank all authors, session chairs, and workshop organizers. But most 
of all, we are grateful to the team who made this stimulating conference possible – Romana 
Rauter, Rupert J. Baumgartner, Aisma L. Kiesnere, and Martina Zimek – thanks very much for 
all your efforts! 
As we are looking forward to have a series of conferences on New Business Models, the 
tradition prescribes to announce the topic and the venue of the next conference. Next year, 
we are going to Sofia, Bulgaria and NBM@Sofia2018 will be hosted at the University of 
National and World Economy. While the NMB@Toulouse2016 and NBM@Graz2017 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
409 
conferences have covered a great number of topics, there are still many stones left unturned 
in the field, and many further contributions possible. For NBM@Sofia2018, we would like to 
draw your attention to the topic of impact. Hence, the title of next year’s conference is:  
“New Business Models with Impact: Focused, Scalable, and International?” 
With NBM@Sofia2018 conference, we would like to stimulate the discussion on how to 
create business models with greater social and environmental impact. Yet, the conference 
topic is meant to encourage and further develop our thinking in the direction of impact.  The 
notion of impact is essential to NBMs. A focus on impact is looking beyond the mere outputs 
of NBMs and considers organisational operations and their long term and lasting effects. 
NBM@Sofia2018 aims at stimulating the discussion on how NBMs unfold the creation of 
social and environmental impact. Of course, all other topics related to NBMs are welcome as 
contributions to next years’ conference. In the context of impact, one could address any of 
the below questions, which are not limitative: 
 How do NBMs realize impact? 
 How to increase the impact of NBMs? 
 How to measure the impact of NBMs? 
 How to report the impact of NBMs 
 How to create international impact with NBMs? 
 Under what circumstances do NBMs decrease their impact? 
 What are the determinants of scalability of new business models? 
 What are the barriers for scalability? 
 Small is beautiful – how to focus on resolving local sustainability issues? 
In addition to the central conference topic, please do not hesitate to submit contributions 
related to the broader domain of NBMs. Both scholarly and practitioner’s contributions are 
welcome. For the realization of your contributions, we are developing various publication 
outlets also for NBM@Sofia 2018. We have already a commitment of the International 
Journal of Corporate Social Responsibility (https://jcsr.springeropen.com/) and Accountancy 
& Bedrijfskunde (http://accountancybusiness.be/about-the-journal#/), and are working on 
other opportunities for publications in good quality outlets. 
NBM@Sofia2018 conference is scheduled at June 27 and 28, 2018 at the University of 
National and World Economy, Sofia, Bulgaria and will be the third edition of this annual 
conference.

Appendix 1: Call for Contribution 
2nd International Conference on 
New Business Models  
NBM@Graz2017 
 
Call for Contributions  
 
Exploring a changing view on organizing value creation: 
Developing New Business Models 
 
 
20-23 June, 2017 | University of Graz, Austria 
 
 
Welcome 
The first conference on New Business Models took place in Toulouse in June 2016. It was 
meant to be the starting point for a series of international conferences on New Business 
Models (NBM). With over 65 international participants, inspiring key-note lectures and an 
attractive and impressive range of presentations and discussions, this initial conference was 
a great success! This success also indicates that the NBM is considered a promising concept 
that is currently influencing and shaping our society’s development and, with luck, its future 
sustainability. However, this was only the beginning; there are still many questions to be 
answered and problems to be solved. As a result of this initial conference, the idea of 
holding an annual international conference on New Business Models was born.  
 
Second NBM conference 
Following up on the success of its predecessor, the second NBM conference will take place 
at the University of Graz, Austria in June 2017. It will provide a platform to continue the 
work that has been started and offer a venue for fruitful discussions, interesting 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
412 
presentations, inspiring key note speeches and interactive business modelling workshops to 
further stimulate and support the promising work on NBMs. Specifically, we invite 
researchers and students as well as practitioners from various backgrounds to share their 
experience and insights with regard to NBMs.  
 
A bird’s-eye view of the conference  
This Call for Contributions aims to attract submissions from various research fields and 
backgrounds, all of which address the generic topic of New Business Models from a broad 
range of perspectives. The sessions (see list below) will draw attention to specific topics that 
range from business models in the context of Circular Economy to digitalization and how 
such trends drive the development of and need for NBMs. Moreover, there will be a session 
explicitly dedicated to ongoing or research projects that have recently been finished by 
Bachelor’s and Master’s students. The conference will also host various workshops on 
business modelling. As a new feature, the three best papers will each be awarded an Annual 
Cloverleaf Award. 
 
Why sustainability matters 
The ‘tissue’ of our Western society is constructed from a myriad of transactions that involve 
the common, individual functions of almost all aspects of our professional and private lives 
such as the provision of workforces, goods, or services. These transactions are carried out in 
a variety of ways by organizing and enabling the delivery of outcomes that are perceived as 
valuable. These outcomes are not only profitable in an economic context, but also reflect a 
broad range of principles by offering various solutions to pressing social and environmental 
problems. Creating new value propositions (which are based on a combination of products 
and services) enables the delivery of outcomes such as improving living conditions for 
mankind and preserving and renewing the natural environment. This extended perspective 
is seen as a contemporary – and much needed – fundamental basis for true value creation. 
Hence, the purpose of this kind of value creation is the simultaneous creation of multiple 
forms of value, such as financial, ecological and social values (e.g., Stubbs and Cocklin, 2008, 
Jonker, 2016). These forms of multiple value creation, however, might only be possible and 
applicable if new and alternative (inter)organizational structures of value creation are 
created. These must be based on the collaboration of new and additional actors who take 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
413 
part in such value creation processes from all societal and economic domains. This not only 
leads to (1) new business models but (2) also the formation of new roles for these actors and 
(3) the question of the tangible and intangible forms of value upon which our societies are 
willing to agree. Moreover, the discussion not only focuses on debates about already 
existing types of business models but also on identifying the building blocks and logics that 
allow the creation of new configurations that address the need for multiple value creation. 
In addition to exploring new ways of value creation, contributions at this conference will also 
shed light on how to enlarge the positive societal impact of these types of business models. 
 
Perspectives on New Business Models 
Given the increasing social and political demands with regard to sustainability, a generation 
of business models is emerging that can be referred to as New Business Models (NBMs). 
They provide a logic (rationale) for value creation that is based on an array of principles that 
encompass cooperation, dematerialization, sharing, or servitisation (e.g., “product as a 
service”). These new forms of business models lead to outcomes based on the following 
guiding principles (Jonker, 2016): 
1. The principle of collaborative value creation, which is the idea that constituents invest in 
creating value together.  
2. The principle of shared value creation, which is the idea that constituents share the value 
they have created collaboratively.  
3. The principle of multiple value creation, which is the simultaneous creation of ecological, 
social and economic values. 
Following these principles has led to the emergence of a breed of business models that are 
also being discussed in the context of green or sustainable business models, which are also 
called business models for sustainability. A recent definition of a business model for 
sustainability was proposed by Schaltegger et al. (2016, p. 6): “A business model for 
sustainability helps describing, analysing, managing, and communicating (i) a company’s 
sustainable value proposition to its customers, and all other stakeholders, (ii) how it creates 
and delivers this value, (iii) and how it captures economic value while maintaining or 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
414 
regenerating natural, social, and economic capital beyond its organizational boundaries.” 
This definition of business models is particularly applicable to companies. The roots of this 
application in subsequent business model research has been presented by Osterwalder 
(2004) and others. The aforementioned principles on which new business models should be 
based enrich this perspective and emphasize an understanding of business models as a 
system of activities between various constituents which intentionally lead to the 
collaborative creation of a broad array of valuable outcomes. As a consequence, this not 
only means that multiple forms of value should be created simultaneously but also that 
companies do not necessarily need to be the centre of the value creation process. Evidently, 
this is a much broader perspective that also refers to inter-organisational or even regional 
business models based on multi-actor approaches. Example include the city as a level upon 
which business models can be developed, or HUBs and regional value-creating networks, all 
of which fit under the umbrella of the definition and principles of New Business Models. 
Due to the different facets, building blocks and functions that are involved in analysing and 
creating business models, many streams of research contribute to the ongoing discussions; 
among these are innovation management, sustainability management, strategic 
management, entrepreneurship and organizational theory. However, while “the relevance of 
business models for corporate performance in general and corporate sustainability in 
particular has been widely acknowledged in the literature” (Schaltegger et al., 2016, p. 264), 
many unanswered questions and research gaps still need to be explored. These topics range 
from the theoretical grounding of NBMs to empirical research to provide support for their 
potentially positive contributions to sustainable development. Moreover, this leads not only 
to the question of how to organize and manage business models per se, but also how 
(circular) economies could look like, in which this new generation of business models is likely 
to successfully emerge. As a consequence, this could imply that a number of existing 
organizations might become obsolete while others will attempt to transform themselves to 
offer new value propositions.

Types of contributions solicited 
We welcome theoretical, conceptual and empirical papers. We also encourage the 
submission of findings from scholarly studies that apply a comprehensive variety of 
methodologies (e.g., qualitative and quantitative) from a broad variety of scholarly 
disciplines (e.g., management, entrepreneurship, environmental studies, organization 
theory, transition theory, change management) and from a broad variety of domains (e.g., 
energy, health, agriculture, food, finance, retail). This Call for Contributions asks scholars, 
students and practitioners to elaborate upon and contribute to, but not limit themselves to, 
the following research questions: 
 
What are the similarities and differences between ‘conventional’ business models 
that have the primary objective of profit generation and the so-called ‘new’ business 
models that have the main objective of value creation and are based on different 
normative principles? 
 
What are the barriers to the introduction and implementation of NBMs, both in 
already-established firms as well as in newly-founded businesses? 
 
What are the mechanisms that drive successful NBMs? What are the identifiable 
success factors of already-established, scaled-up NBMs that could be also transferred 
to other contexts or other types of organizations? 
 
What are potential motivations and incentives for various constituents to become 
part of such new ways of value creation and value sharing? 
 
How can already established NBMs be scaled-up? Which types of supporting 
mechanisms are needed in order to support scaling-up-processes that have the 
purpose of generating long-lasting effects and impacts? 
 
How can NBMs be protected in niches to provide them with time and space for their 
development?  
 
How are NBMs both solving and (potentially) creating new issues in the context of 
Sustainable Development? 
 
How should new governance forms and strategies for business models be explored 
and developed to reflect alternative normative and subjective values, particularly in 
inter-organizational, regional or even national or international contexts?  

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
416 
 
How could interdisciplinary research further stimulate the theoretical development 
of NBMs by combining different points of view? 
 
How can empirical proofs for the success and impact but also the failure of NBMs be 
provided? 
 
Conference design and session themes 
 
The design of the conference is based upon nine sessions, each of which will provide a clear 
thematic focus. In each session, a limited number of presentations will be accommodated. 
This will enable participants to address a comprehensive range of issues in three parallel 
sessions over two days. The conference offers the opportunity for both established 
researchers as well as undergraduate and graduate students to present the results of 
academic research, but practitioners are also invited to submit contributions on the 
proposed themes.  
In addition to the sessions dedicated to presentations and discussions, three to four 
interactive workshops will be held in which new business modelling tools will be explored 
through hands-on exercises. These workshops will last 60 to 90 minutes and offer 
participants the opportunity to apply different approaches to business modelling in an 
experimental manner. There is no need to submit an abstract to attend these workshops but 
due to the limited number of spaces, participants are asked to register with their conference 
registration. 
 
Below, a preliminary overview of sessions and workshops is provided. Regular updates and 
the final program will be published on the conference website in early 2017.

Session 1 
Organising Business Models for the Circular Economy 
Chairs: Jan Jonker and Niels Faber 
Unmistakably, politics and business (re)discover the notion of a circular economy fuelled by 
an increased urgency to address wicked ecological and societal problems. Crafting such an 
economy is shaped at three levels: Micro (within individual organisations), Meso (between 
businesses, governmental organisations and any other constituents) and Macro (at the level 
of the overall economic system). In this session, we would like to focus on the Meso-level to 
address questions of how different constituents shape and organise closed loops, which is 
one of the key design-principles of the CE. How do they collectively create a business model? 
What kind of organisational models are crafted? What is the nature of the revenue model? 
This session not only addresses the material aspects of organising closed-loops but also 
aspects around revenue sharing (e.g., cascading), transition and collaboration and 
governance. We welcome both conceptual and empirical contributions. 
 
Session 2  
New Business Models, Sustainable Development and Corporate Strategic Management 
Chairs: Rupert J. Baumgartner and Romana Rauter 
 
New business models are intensively discussed as a possibility to foster a transition to more 
sustainable societies. Two aspects are relevant to determine whether new business models 
will really be able to support this transition: First, they have to contribute to the goals of 
sustainable development and second, new business models must be successful in the long-
term. Both aspects are related to (corporate) strategy, which can be defined as a vision of 
success prescribing ways to reach this success. Therefore, descriptive as well as explanatory 
contributions that specifically, but not exclusively, deal with the following topics are invited: 
 
Do new business models really contribute to the goals of Sustainable Development 
and, if so, what does the contribution look like?  
 
How can the sustainability impacts of new business models be measured? 
 
What is the relationship between new business models and competitive strategies? 
What is the relationship between new business models and the corporate 
sustainability strategies of companies? 
 Which insights have been gathered from the established concepts of strategic 
management (i.e., the market-based, resource-based and relational views) and how 
can these be used for the development, implementation and improvement of new 
business models?

Session 3 
Managing Sustainability-Oriented Business Models: Frameworks, Tools, and Cases  
Chairs: Florian Lüdeke-Freund and Esben Rahbek Gjerdrum Pedersen 
This session shall feature case studies, new management frameworks and instruments that 
offer new insights into how entrepreneurs and managers can develop, implement, operate 
and assess their business models for sustainability (BMfS). The aim is to cover the following 
topics and questions (non-exclusive list):  
1. Developing BMfS: How are new BMfS initiated? Which tools are applied in practice 
to develop sustainability-oriented business models? What is the experience of the 
users? What are best practices? Who is engaging in business model innovation? 
What are the barriers to ecologically- and socially-motivated business model 
innovation?  
2. Implementing BMfS: How can new and sustainability-oriented business models be 
implemented? What are the major barriers? How can structural or cognitive 
resistance, internally and externally, be overcome? What roles do founders, 
financers, entrepreneurs and external partners play? How can planning-
implementation gaps be dealt with?  
3. Operating and controlling BMfS: Once implemented, how are sustainability-oriented 
business models maintained? How are mission-drift and other tensions avoided? 
Who is responsible for controlling business model performance? How are operating 
models kept on track? How do BMfS evolve over time? What changes and 
adaptations can be observed?  
4. Assessing BMfS: Controlling whether business models support the firms’ 
sustainability performance requires assessment tools and frameworks. What kind of 
assessment – and in a broader sense accounting – frameworks and tools are applied 
to manage the business models’ sustainability performance? What are the impacts of 
BMfS from business as well as societal perspectives?

Session 4  
Business Models for Social Entrepreneurship 
Chairs: Nikolay Dentchev and Philippe Eiselein 
Social entrepreneurs use a for-profit minded approach to address specific social issue(s) 
(Austin, Howard, & Wei-Skillern, 2006; Dees, Anderson, & Wei-skillern, 2004; Defourny & 
Nyssens, 2010). This approach results in the development of new business models that often 
focus on creating more than one specific value (i.e., economic and social value) for multiple 
stakeholders (Jonker, 2016).  Social entrepreneurs are confronted with more complex 
business models. Not only does this double- or multiple-bottom-line approach (Moss, Short, 
Payne, & Lumpkin, 2011; Pache & Andre, 2016) complicate the business model of social 
entrepreneurship (Certo & Miller, 2008), but its core activities involve dealing with problems 
that others cannot resolve (Miller, Grimes, McMullen, & Vogus, 2012). Social 
entrepreneurship often takes place in settings in which it is considerably difficult for any kind 
of business to survive (Dees, 1998; Mair & Martí, 2006). Still, social entrepreneurship has 
witnessed the development of various types of strategies for growth over the last decade 
which are often based on the principle of replicability at their core innovation. However, 
scaling up the social impact of these sustainable business models remains an important 
challenge for practitioners as well as a research avenue for academicians (Weber, Kröger, & 
Lambrich, 2012). 
 
Can social enterprises benefit from the economies of scale? 
 
Could social entrepreneurs also scale up the social impact of their business model by 
applying non-replicability principles? 
 
What is the ‘most effective’ scaling path for the business models of social 
entrepreneurs? 
 
To what extent do social impact measurements help social enterprises scale up their 
impact?

Session 5 
Business Models in the Age of Digitalisation 
Chairs: Romana Rauter, Christiana Müller, Wolfgang Vorraber 
While digitalisation is definitively no longer a new trend, it (still) puts pressure on companies 
(and other types of organisations) to reflect on their strategies and identify new business 
opportunities. At the same time, digitalisation creates endless opportunities to rethink value 
creation processes and come up with new business models. Hence, digitalisation could also 
offer new solutions for existing societal and/or ecological problems by changing the ways in 
which actors work together. In this context, we seek contributions that address questions 
such as: Which role does digitalisation play for value creation, value proposition and value 
capturing? Which new business models have emerged as a result of increasing digitalisation? 
How have such business models contributed to sustainable development? How has 
increased digitalisation led to new forms of cooperation and transaction? Thereby, empirical 
as well as conceptual papers or best practice examples are welcomed. 
 
 
Session 6 
Circular 
Economy: 
What’s 
Society 
Got 
to 
Do 
with 
It? 
Chairs: Niels Faber and Jan Jonker 
While society is paying an increasing amount of attention to a circular economy, some 
principal elements of this broad concept still need to be explored. The circular economy is 
principally conceptualised around material flows and closed loops. The organisational and 
wider economic consequences for business and government are gradually becoming clear. 
Implementing such an economic model will lead to transition but what has hardly been 
touched upon is the social aspect of the CE and, in particular, the impact it has had on 
society. The conventional economy has been praised for having brought general wealth to 
society. It is only fair to ask what society at large will gain from the circular economy. Will it 
create new jobs? If so, which ones? What new demands will the CE place on civilians? What 
part does society need to play in closing material loops? These are tantalising questions that 
open up a whole new field of inquiry. We seek contributions that focus on the societal 
perspective of circular economy. Conceptual as well as empirical contributions are welcome.

Session 7 
Crafting Regional Business Models 
Chairs: Moniek Kamm 
On a local and regional level, we can observe the emergence of new-inter organisational, 
networking forms of organizing that enable multiple value-creation in a cooperative manner. 
Private, public and civil society constituents explore and craft cooperation in order to 
address difficult problems, establish common goals and develop an array of products and 
services. In doing so, they either intentionally or incidentally support transitions towards 
more sustainability on a regional scale.  
 
This emerging movement can be observed in various countries across Europe. It deserves 
scrupulous and conscientious field-research in order to better understand the mechanism 
and principles that are fostering this phenomenon. We can identify at least two research 
challenges concerning the formation, organisation and effectiveness of such novel forms of 
organising, which lead to the development of questions such as (i) how do constituents of 
these collaborative forms of organising realise effective, lasting forms of organising and (ii) 
how do they craft strategies in practice that are beneficial to their collective actions?  
We are looking for contributions related, but not limited, to the above-mentioned research 
questions. We especially welcome contributions that involve field research and 
(comparative) theoretical and empirical case studies in this area.  
 
Session 8 
Insights on Business Models from Young Academics  
Chairs: Martina Zimek and Aisma Linda Kiesnere 
This session focuses on scientific contributions from Bachelor’s and Master’s students, allowing 
young academicians to present their research results and voice their point of view based on 
their research. The research must be related to the relevant questions raised in the Call for 
Contributions and can also be presented as works-in-progress. The session will contribute to 
increasing the understanding of how particular aspects of New Business Models foster 
organizational performance in both profit and non-profit, organizations over the long term, 
and how the new models contribute to sustainable development.

Session 9  
When 
business 
models 
have 
to 
be 
explained 
in 
corporate 
reporting 
Chairs: Stéphane Trébucq and Elisabetta Magnaghi 
Financial analysts carefully read corporate reports and try to understand how companies 
create value. Unfortunately, financial statements do not tell the whole story. Social 
Responsibility Investment funds have also raised some new questions about stakeholder 
value creation and the outcomes of companies' activities for society. Recently, since the end 
of 2013, the IIRC (International Integrated Reporting Council) has also proposed the use of a 
new reporting framework to present the business model in a single report in a short, clear 
and concise way. This session will provide authors with the opportunity to discuss the quality 
of accounting information about business models and the way companies should 
communicate about their business model. In addition, the new directive on non-financial 
information (UE/2014/95) addresses the necessity to include a brief description of the 
business model in corporate reporting for a better understanding of the corporate 
performance. 
Some key questions might be: 
How can accounting information and information systems be modified so that investors or 
stakeholders can be more effectively informed about the business model? 
 
Are companies able to improve their explanations of their business model? 
 
Why are such companies interested in implementing new reporting standards of 
communication such as integrated reporting <IR>? 
 
Are business models from these companies transitioning toward a sustainable 
economy, and how can such companies demonstrate evidence of this transition? 


Workshop 1 
Designing Sustainable Businesses with the Honeycomb Business Model Design Tool 
Workshop organizer: Karen Miller 
Businesses face substantial challenges to remain relevant in contemporary contexts 
characterised by complexity and turbulence. In these environments, factors from economic, 
environmental and social standpoints collide. Consequently, it is imperative to develop new 
sustainable business models, but these are potentially risk-laden and challenging to innovate 
as multiple potentially conflicting elements must be considered. To respond to this issue, the 
Honeycomb Business Model Design Tool, which builds upon the merits of pre-existing tools, 
has been advanced through an iterative 18-month process. The tool is intended to provide 
teams with an organic structural approach to holistically design sustainable business models 
that respond to complex challenges. In this workshop, participants will first be provided with 
a rich hands-on introduction to the Honeycomb Business Model Design Tool. Second, they 
will have the opportunity to help shape the tool's ongoing development. 
 
Workshop 2 
How to Model Sustainable Business – The Business Innovation Kit and Sustainability 
Innovation Pack 
Workshop organizers: Henning Breuer and Florian Lüdeke-Freund 
The workshop organizers, Henning and Florian, will demonstrate the Business Innovation Kit 
and Sustainability Innovation Pack in action. The toolkit facilitates modelling sustainable 
business and revenue models. It was developed and iteratively refined in numerous 
workshops with innovation managers, representatives of start-ups and students. 
 
Workshop 3  
Exploring 
a 
model 
for 
the 
organization 
of 
the 
Circular 
Economy 
Workshop organizer: Hans Stegeman 
The Circular Economy (CE) has mostly been studied at the firm-level, which has led to 
insights in organizational and design principles. However, it is necessary to gain a conceptual 
understanding of CE on meso- and macro levels, since a belief exists that these micro 
practices lead to sustainable development on a higher (systems) level. Still, the empirical 
proof for this claim is insubstantial. No structured insights into the effects of CE on a macro 
level have been gained with respect to feedback loops, substitution effects or labor markets. 
This workshop allows participants to explore and develop a System Dynamics (SD) macro 
model for the CE using a Group Model Building (GMB) approach. SD is a potentially suitable 
approach that can be used to address this conceptual problem. It is suitable for 
conceptualizing a closed loop system model with feedback loops. The proposed CE model 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
424 
will theoretically be based on stock-flow models and industrial ecology. Methodologically, it 
will be in line with the modelling tradition that started with the seminal research conducted 
by the Club of Rome.  
Participants are invited to actively apply their knowledge and help construct a model, 
beginning with a causal loop diagram and then refining and clarifying different elements and 
feedback loops.  
The workshop is part of a PhD project that is being conducted at the Nijmegen School of 
Management (Radboud University, The Netherlands). 
 
Workshop 4 
Identifying Value Opportunities with the Sustainable Value Analysis Tool Workshop 
organizers: Miying Yang and Doroteya Vladimirova 
The Sustainable Value Analysis Tool was developed to help companies discover new value 
opportunities by identifying value that had been uncaptured by key stakeholders across the 
entire product life cycle. The tool has been used for sustainable business model innovation 
in numerous companies from various sectors. In this workshop, the organizers will 
demonstrate the use of the tool and lead participants through a case study during a sample 
session. The workshop is hands-on; all participants will use the tool to identify new value 
opportunities and learn how to integrate sustainability into business model innovation with 
the tool. The Sustainable Value Analysis tool has been integrated in a broader research 
programme on sustainable business models run at the Centre for Industrial Sustainability at 
the University of Cambridge.

Background 
This request for papers for the Special Issue of the International Journal of Corporate Social 
Responsibility focuses on exploring Business Models for the Circular Economy. The Special 
Issue will consist of approximately seven papers. 
The Special Issue’s primary topic is ‘exploring a changing view on inter-organizational value 
creation’. The traditional, economic view on value creation is increasingly being determined 
to be too restricted and limited for facing current societal and environmental challenges. In 
response, the multiple value creation perspective has emerged from the realm of 
sustainability as a concept that is able to address these challenges in a comprehensive and 
coherent manner in society. It is a perspective that, in addition to financial value, it also 
incorporates those that are social and environmental. One of the emerging trends in society 
is to explore this concept of multiple value creation under the heading of the circular 
economy (CE). In particular, the CE focuses on the material aspects of the economy and 
society, aiming at creating closed material and energy loops. 
The vision of a CE, although not new, poses a broad range of new and rather unexplored 
challenges to entrepreneurs, managers, and other economic actors who attempt to 
implement concepts such as nature-inspired processes, products and services, the cradle-to-
cradle process and product design, or bio-mimicry, for example. This list is not exhaustive. 
The idea of a CE builds mainly on fields such as industrial ecology, eco-design, and 
engineering. It poses the challenge of connecting CE concepts and the ways that 
entrepreneurs and managers can organize new forms of inter-organizational and multiple 
value creation. 
In parallel, New Business Models (NBM) have developed that intend to construct multiple 
value creation and new forms of organizing that enable it. NBMs fundamentally differ from 
our current notion of business models and thus the ways that organizations are structured 
and how they function. They build on a set of principles related to the values created, offer a 
value proposition addressing these, and build and thrive on a specific and closely connected 
community. Various types of organizations that have adopted NBMs have been described in 
literature. Among these are social enterprises, co-operatives, multi-stakeholder platforms, 
or public-private partnerships. Each of these NBMs operates on the premise of multiple 
value creation. In addition to the CE, NBMs aim to answer the call for a more sustainable 
way of value creation in present society that is addressed by a community-based approach. 
Types of contributions solicited 
For this Special Issue, we welcome theoretical, conceptual, and empirical papers focusing on 
business models directly related to the concept of the circular economy. Papers from a 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
432 
broad variety of methodologies (e.g., literature review, qualitative and quantitative research 
methods), a broad variety of research fields (e.g., entrepreneurship, environmental studies, 
management, economics, social sciences, etc.), and a wide scope of domains (e.g., energy, 
health, agriculture, finance, industry, retail, etc.) are admissible as long as they are either 
developing theoretical and conceptual insights into the Circular Economy or are based on 
the extensive analysis of cases. 
We encourage participants to the New Business Models Conference in Graz, Austria, 
occurring June 20 to June 23 2017, to submit their contributions for publication.  
Themes on New Business Models for the Circular Economy 
Scholars and practitioners should elaborate and contribute, but not limit themselves, to the 
following research questions concerning business models for the Circular Economy: 
• 
What are the barriers to the introduction and implementation of NBMs for the 
Circular Economy both in already-established firms as well as in newly-founded 
businesses? 
• 
What are the similarities and differences between ‘conventional’ business models 
that have the primary objective of profit generation and the so-called ‘new’ 
business models for the circular economy that have the main objective of 
multiple value creation and are based on different normative principles? 
• 
What are the mechanisms that drive successful NBMs for the Circular Economy? 
• 
What are potential motivations and incentives for various constituents to become 
involved in new ways of value creation and value sharing in the Circular Economy 
(e.g., cascading, governance, revenue models)? 
• 
How can already established NBMs for the Circular Economy be scaled-up? Which 
types of supporting mechanisms either in business or in government are needed 
in order to support scaling-up-processes that have the purpose of generating 
long-lasting effects and impacts? 
• 
How can NBMs for the Circular Economy be protected in niches to provide them 
with time and space for their development? Once developed, how can these 
NBMs be encouraged to leave their niches? 
• 
How are NBMs for the Circular Economy both solving and (potentially) creating 
new issues concerning the contribution to Sustainable Development? 
• 
How should new governance forms and strategies for business models for the 
Circular Economy be explored and developed to reflect alternative normative and 
subjective values, particularly in inter-organizational, regional, or even national or 
international contexts? 
 
This list of themes and research questions is not exhaustive. The request for papers follows 
the theme of the conference at which the Circular Economy is addressed in an appropriate 
manner.

1. Background 
This call for paper encourages submissions from participants to the New Business Models 
Conference in Graz Universität, Austria on 20-23 June 2017 (http://new-business-
models.uni-graz.at/en/). Although participation to the conference is recommended, it is not 
a precondition for publication. The main topic of the conference is related to the “changing 
view on value creation.” Value has often been considered in the strict economic sense, 
although its reach, depth, implications and meaning spans also over social and 
environmental contexts. These latter perspectives have received increased attention in 
recent years, leading to new, multi-value propositions. Multi-value propositions, in turn, 
deliver outcomes on current challenging socio-environmental issues. In most cases, for 
multi-value propositions to work, new forms of organizations see the daylight, which implies 
the rise of New Business Models (NBM). NBM challenge our understanding of existing 
business models, and drive us to dealing with multiple value creation processes, compared 
to their predecessors. 
Examples of such NBMs are coming from social entrepreneurs’ organizations and efforts. 
These entrepreneurs incorporate a clear social mission to alleviate a currently-left-undealt-
with social problems, whilst pursuing entrepreneurial efforts in the classical sense, i.e. 
pursuing economic objectives. Social entrepreneurial business models are often very 
complex, due to not only their specific mission, but also by the fact that these deal with 
problems others cannot solve, in settings others cannot survive in. Whilst the rising social 
and environmental needs for such alternative ways is unfortunate, it creates a changing view 
on what value really constitutes, and does indirectly entails a more elaborate and mature 
generation of business models.   
2. Types of contributions solicited 
For this issue, we welcome papers with a strong practical insight. Papers might come from 
both practitioners and/or academics, and need to contain practical implications. Further, we 
solicit papers from a broad variety of methodologies (e.g. literature review, qualitative and 
quantitative research mentods), as well as a broad variety of disciplines (e.g. 
entrepreneurship, environmental studies, management, etc.). Both conceptual and empirical 
papers are welcome for this issues (case studies, interviews, opinion pieces, etc.). Papers 
coming from all various topics of the Graz Conference are welcome. 
3. Themes on New Business Models

success factors of already-established, scaled-up NBMs that could be also transferred 
to other contexts or other types of organizations? 
• 
What are potential motivations and incentives for various constituents to become part 
of such new ways of value creation and value sharing? 
• 
How can already established NBMs be scaled-up? Which types of supporting 
mechanisms are needed in order to support scaling-up-processes that have the 
purpose of generating long-lasting effects and impacts? 
• 
How can NBMs be protected in niches to provide them with time and space for their

CALL FOR PAPERS 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
439 
Aim and motivation 
Value creation, associated with how organizations create, propose, and deliver products and 
services that are of value for customers, while they try to capture a share of the overall value 
created, is a core issue in business model research (Massa et al., 2017; Wirtz et al., 2016). 
Although business model scholars sometimes refer to value creation with and for 
stakeholders (e.g., Evans et al., 2017; Upward & Jones, 2016), this notion is mostly limited to 
value propositions for customers and contributions from and to business partners such as 
suppliers or investors. Such limited notions of value, value creation and the dispersion of 
value among stakeholders, in turn lead to correspondingly limited perspectives on business 
models and business model innovation, which are insufficient to deal with important and 
pressing issues of, for example, ecological and social value creation (see in particular the 
critique in Upward & Jones, 2016). 
This call for papers shall therefore motivate authors from various disciplines, first, to take a 
closer look at theories, concepts, and cases that apply more comprehensive and 
stakeholdersensitive notions of value and value creation (cf., Freeman, 2010), second, to 
consider diverse forms of value (e.g., economic, ecological, social, cultural, relational, 
psychological etc.) and their underlying values (Breuer & Lüdeke-Freund, 2017), and third, to 
explicitly connect such comprehensive notions of value and value creation to business 
models and business model innovation (cf., Massa et al., 2017; Wirtz et al., 2016).  
Scope and topics 
The special issue will particularly deal with, but will not be limited to, forms of sustainable 
value creation, understood as integrated approaches to creating ecological, social, and 
economic value and to explicitly dealing with and overcoming the trade-offs associated with 
sustainable value creation (e.g., Hahn et al., 2010). Sustainable value creation takes into 
account the risks of negative impacts on ecological systems and human societies as well as 
the challenge of surviving as an organisation. But truly sustainable value creation is not only 
about avoiding harm. It is also about achieving netpositive effects for a prospering natural 
environment and human livelihoods – a perspective that is sometimes referred to as strong 
sustainability (e.g., Upward & Jones, 2016). While we would like to motivate authors to 
consider more recent concepts such as value created, missed, or destroyed for stakeholders 
(e.g., Yang et al., 2017), it is also worthwhile to revisit earlier concepts of sustainable value 
creation (e.g., Hart & Milstein, 2003; Figge & Hahn, 2004, 2005), general frameworks of 
corporate sustainability and triple bottomline management (e.g., Schaltegger & Burritt, 
2015; Baumgartner & Rauter, 2017), and recent developments in the discourse on business 
models for sustainability (Schaltegger et al., 2016).  

 
NBM@Graz2017 
 
440 
In addition to considering ecological and social issues, the special issue also welcomes 
sociological, cultural and psychological perspectives (e.g., values shifts in society, 
stakeholder perceptions of value offerings) as long as they are clearly connected to business 
models. In terms of methods, the special issue is open to all forms of qualitative, 
quantitative, theoretical, and empirical research. Innovative approaches are most welcome, 
such as psychological analyses of business model experiments or developing and testing 
(material) artefacts to support business model innovation and value creation with and for 
stakeholders. 
Taken together, this special issue aims at exploring the variety of stakeholders and their 
particular needs which can – and should – be considered in organizational value creation, 
the variety of forms of value offered to them, and how business models contribute to 
creating these forms of value. Besides value creation, value destruction or cases where 
important forms of value are neglected should also be considered (e.g., Yang et al., 2017). 
Contributions to this special issue can address but are not limited to the following indicative 
questions and topics:  
 
 What is value and how is it created? Which forms of value and value creation 
processes are missing from current business model research? Which value theories, 
from fields as diverse as economics, psychology, business ethics, philosophy or 
design, can help to broaden the current scope of business model research towards 
sustainable value creation? Besides sustainable and integrative forms of value and 
value creation, we are also interested in perspectives and theories from outside of 
management studies (such as cultural, psychological, or design research). 
 Which instruments can be used to help organizations develop and implement new 
value creation processes in practice? How can these instruments and processes be 
tested and evaluated? Besides these practical questions, new research instruments 
and strategies that are rather under-represented in business model research, such as 
lab experiments (e.g., eye tracking) or large sample studies (using statistical means), 
are also of interest, as long as these further our understanding of sustainable value 
creation. 
 Value creation is increasingly becoming an interrelational, interorganizational, and 
networkbased issue. How can value be created in relationships, multiorganizational 
and network settings? How can members of such settings define and negotiate their 
individual and joint interests, value definitions, and resulting synergies but also 
conflicts? What does true sharing of value mean in such settings, beyond rather 
narrow and instrumental definitions of value and creation? • Where suitable, case 
studies may be used to look into the above proposed research questions and topics. 
Single cases as well as larger samples of comparative cases are welcome, as are

longitudinal studies of organizations and the evolution and transformation of their 
approaches to value creation. Since this special issue addresses several gaps in 
current business model research, systematic practice and literature reviews may also 
be suitable formats.
