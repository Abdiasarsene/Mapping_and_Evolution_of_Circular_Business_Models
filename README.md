# Circular Business Models Analysis

This repository focuses on analyzing the evolution and trends in circular business models using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It explores themes through **thematic analysis** with LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), visualizes keywords with **word clouds**, and performs **semantic analysis** leveraging spaCy.

## Features

- **Thematic Analysis**:
  - Implements LDA for topic modeling to identify dominant themes across textual data.
- **Keyword Visualization**:
  - Generates word clouds to highlight the most frequently occurring terms and keywords.
- **Semantic Analysis**:
  - Leverages spaCy for analyzing word relationships, phrase dependencies, and sentiment/context comprehension.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.8+
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical computations
- `matplotlib` and `wordcloud` for data visualization
- `spacy` for semantic analysis
- `gensim` for LDA-based topic modeling

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/circular-business-models-analysis.git
