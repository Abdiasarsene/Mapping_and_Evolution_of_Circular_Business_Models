# Circular Business Models Analysis

  The circular economy is increasingly cited as a necessary transition to promote 
sustainability and reduce economic dependence on finite resources (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017; 
Stahel, 2016). Circular business models play a crucial role in this transition, as they help 
companies to operationalize circular principles. Although there has been increasing research
on circular business models in recent years, a systematic overview of their evolution and the 
different archetypes used in the literature is lacking (LÃ¼deke-Freund et al., 2019; Geissdoerfer 
et al., 2020).

  The diversity and complexity of circular business models not only complicate 
theoretical conceptualization, but also make it difficult for companies to select and implement 
a suitable model. The multitude of models and frameworks leads to a lack of clarity about how 
they can be applied in practice and how they relate to each other. This not only limits scientific 
progress, but also makes it more challenging for companies to make strategic decisions in the 
field of circular entrepreneurship (Bocken et al., 2014; LÃ¼deke-Freund et al., 2019).
